The '''Mercedes-Benz W105''' is an automobile produced by [[Mercedes-Benz]] from 1956 to 1959 and marketed as the '''Mercedes-Benz Typ 219'''. Part of the "[[Mercedes-Benz Ponton|Ponton]]" family, it featured a 2.2 L [[inline-6|inline 6-cylinder]] engine. 

==History==
The ponton body shape had been introduced in 1953 by the [[Mercedes-Benz W120|W120 chassis 180]]. In the following year, Mercedes-Benz introduced the 6-cylinder [[Mercedes-Benz W180|220a]] which was visually similar to the 180, but with 70&nbsp;mm added to the front wings to accommodate two extra cylinders and 100&nbsp;mm added to the rear doors to provide some extra legroom for the rear passengers. This model ran until 1956 when the 219 and the [[Mercedes-Benz W180|220S]] were introduced.

==Model identification==
The 219 from the a-pillar forward was identical to the long-nosed 220a, including the single-carburettor 2.2 L 6-cylinder engine. However, from the a-pillar back, it used the shorter body of the W120/W121 180/190 models. This can be identified by the one-piece windows in the rear doors, as opposed to the 220a and 220S having separate quarter windows.

Inside, the 219 used the simpler instrumentation of the small car, along with bakelite trim instead of woodgrain.

The '''Guyson E12''' was a run of two cars commissioned by hill-climb champion Jim Thomson and built by [[William Towns]].<ref name=icon>[http://www.aronline.co.uk/index.htm?townsguysonf.htm Guyson E12] AROnline Retrieved: 27 March 2010</ref>
It was a rebodied series III [[Jaguar E-Type|E-Type Jaguar]], the first of which came about as a result of Thomson crashing his Jaguar in 1972. The first model was completed for Thomson in 1974 with Towns subsequently converting his own E-Type.

The '''third generation [[Ford Focus]]''' (also known as '''MK III''') debuted at the [[North American International Auto Show#2010|2010 North American International Auto Show]] as a 2012 model. The cars shown were a 4-door sedan and 5-door hatchback, also debuting a new 2.0L [[Fuel injection#Direct injection|direct injection]] I4 engine. A 5-door estate (wagon) was previewed at the Geneva auto show a month later.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=33304 |title=Exciting New Next-Generation Ford Focus Gears Up For Launch &#124; Ford Motor Company Newsroom |publisher=Media.ford.com |date= |accessdate=June 18, 2011}}</ref>

This generation of Focus would be the first [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] vehicle designed under the tenure of CEO [[Alan Mulally]] and his "One Ford" plan, which aimed to leverage Ford's global resources into creating more competitive vehicles that could be sold globally in each segment with minimal changes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ford Focus chief quits|url=http://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/ford-focus-chief-quits|accessdate=30 June 2015|work=[[Autocar]]|publisher=[[Haymarket Media Group|Haymarket Publications]]}}</ref>

The "One Ford" plan would reunite the North American and global Focus line. The [[Ford Focus (second generation, North America)|previous North American version]] was thus discontinued, and the new model was launched simultaneously in North America and Europe on May 2, 2011, both having started production near the end of 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autoweek.com/article/20100118/DETROIT/100119915 |title=Detroit auto show: 2012 Ford Focus, most significant by AW Editors' Choice Awards |publisher=Autoweek.com |date=January 18, 2010 |accessdate=November 29, 2010|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20100121171755/http://www.autoweek.com/article/20100118/DETROIT/100119915 |archivedate = January 21, 2010|deadurl=yes}}</ref><ref>{{cite press release |url=http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=31755 |title=DYNAMIC NEXT-GENERATION FORD FOCUS DEBUTS |date=January 11, 2009 |accessdate=January 11, 2010 |publisher=[[Ford Motor Company]]}}</ref> Production in Asia, Africa, and South America followed later.

Ford debuted the all-electric Ford Focus Electric at the [[Consumer Electronics Show]] in 2011 to compete with the [[Nissan Leaf]] and the [[Chevrolet Volt]] and announced the [[hot hatch]] ST model at the [[Paris Motor Show]] in September 2010.

The Ford Focus was the best-selling car in the world for 2012.<ref>[http://editorial.autos.msn.com/blogs/autosblogpost.aspx?post=619afc64-1886-4110-a3f0-a1df03b47726 James Tate, Ford Focus is best-selling model worldwide in 2012, editorial.autos.msn.com] Retrieved on 11 April 2013</ref>

== Design ==
The design built on Ford's [[Kinetic Design]]. At the front, lights have an different shape while a trapezoidal grille has introduced triangular features. At the rear, hatchback tail lights were positioned lower similar to [[Ford Fiesta]]. The interior has been changed from the second generation in the NA and International versions. Ford wanted to make the Focus more upmarket so it offers two types of central consoles, the basic is with smaller engines and the premium is available more powerful engines.

This generation of Focus incorporated a redesigned cabin changed materials and new infotainment system. Following the industry trend towards decontenting and in keeping with the sedan's downmarket "economy car" image vs. the "premium" hatchback, the earlier sedan's space-saving gas strut trunk hinges are replaced with cheaper, intrusive goose neck hinges. The Focus also has Ford's patented capless fuel tank, which doesn't require a cap to prevent [[siphon]]ing.

== Production ==
The Focus is being promoted as a global car,<ref>{{cite web|title=Campaign Tactics: Ford Focus Global Launch|url=http://www.brandchannel.com/home/post/2011/02/25/Ford-Focus-Global-Launch.aspx|work=Brand Channel|accessdate=July 10, 2012|date=February 25, 2011}}</ref> built in several different factories around the world, with changes to engine line-ups and trim levels to suit regional markets and regulations.

Various trim levels are available, with SE and Titanium on both sedan and hatchback, and a budget S level for the sedan only.

=== Engine lineup in North America ===
The Focus was launched with only one engine option, a 2.0-litre [[Mazda L engine#2.0 L .28LF-DE.2C LF-VE.2C LF-VD.29|Duratec 20]] [[gasoline direct injection|direct injected]], [[Variable Cam Timing#Ti-VCT|Ti-VCT]] [[Inline-four engine|4-cylinder]], producing {{Convert|160|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}.

For the 2015 refresh, the EcoBoost 1.0 litre three-cylinder began to be offered in North America as an extra-cost option.

=== Running Changes ===
Color choices were restricted during summer 2011, due to supply issues caused by the 2011 Japanese earthquake/tsunami. When black and dark blue returned they were replaced by different shades, although the phaseout of Kona Blue in favor of Sonic Blue had been planned.
In January 2012, Ford announced that the formerly automatic-only Titanium model would be offered with a manual transmission. In March 2012, Ford revised the ordering guide for the Titanium models to also have a [[MyFord Touch]] delete option, replacing it with the non-touch version of MyFord. Although MyFord Touch is an $995 option on SEL models and the PowerShift automatic a $1095 option on S and SE, no discount is applied to either manual or non-Touch Titanium models.
2013 model year changes for non-STs are; SE models gain standard SYNC and alloy wheels, the SEL trim is discontinued in favor of an "SE Appearance package" that includes most of the SEL features but with standard trim choices limited to black leather, while Titanium models also pick up standard leather upholstery. All now come standard with the 5-speed manual leaving the SFE pack as the last remaining automatic-only Focus (apart from the direct-drive electric), and color choices are rearranged.
<br style="clear:both" />

=== Reliability issues ===
Along with the [[Ford Fiesta]], the Focus equipped with the [[Ford PowerShift transmission]] has received much criticism due to transmission shuddering, including several [[lemon law]] claims. Ford claims that the transmission, a [[semi-automatic transmission]], is designed to improve [[Fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy]] and has issued several software upgrades for the transmission. To date, the [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] has not required Ford to issue a [[Product recall|recall]], nor has Ford issued a recall voluntarily. Focus models equipped with the conventional [[manual transmission]] have not been affected by the reliability issues.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.wtae.com/investigations/investigation-finds-hundreds-of-complaints-about-ford-transmissions/24333878|title=Investigation finds hundreds of complaints about Ford transmissions|first=Paul|last=Van Osdol|work=[[WTAE-TV]]|publisher=[[Hearst Television]]|date=February 6, 2014|accessdate=March 20, 2015}}</ref>

The UK range is available in hatchback and estate (wagon) in a large number of trim variants including. Most other European countries, including the Republic of Ireland, also include the four-door saloon, unlike Britain, as previous generation sales did not sell as well in comparison with the hatchback and estate.

== Facelift (Post-2014) ==
The Ford Focus facelift (Mk 3.5) was shown at the 2014 Geneva Motor Show, and features a raft of changes made to both the exterior, interior and engine line up.

Changes include:
*[[Lane Keeping Aid]] + [[Lane Keeping Alert]]
*[[Driver Alert]]
*[[Hill Start Assist]]
*[[Blind Spot Information System]]
*[[Adaptive Cruise Control]] (ACC) with [[Distance Indication]]/[[Distance Alert]]
*[[Pre-Collision Assist]]
*[[Forward Alert]]
*[[Active Braking]]
*[[Active City Stop]]
*[[Bi-Xenon]] Headlamps with [[Adaptive Lighting]]
*[[Auto High Beam]]
*[[Traffic Sign Recognition]]
*[[Torque Vectoring Control]]
*[[Auto Start-Stop]]
*[[Active Grille Shutter]]
*[[Tyre Pressure Monitoring System]]

Revisions made to the body were thinner and sharper headlights, a new trapezoidal grille, giving the front more sporting intent than the previous model. The new front end is similar to that of the [[Ford Mondeo (fourth generation)|Mondeo]] as well as the facelifted [[Ford Fiesta|Fiesta]] that was introduced in 2013, inspired by the 2011 [[Ford Evos]] concept as well as various [[Aston Martin]] vehicles. (Ford owns an 8% interest in Aston Martin.)  The [[Ford C-Max|recently facelifted Ford C-Max and Grand C-Max]], [[Ford S-Max|the all-new S-Max]] and [[Ford Galaxy|Galaxy]], have also incorporated the new family face. On Titanium and Titanium X the grille is chrome, and on other versions it is black mesh. The ST features a Black honeycomb grille.The front fog-lights were also changed. At the rear on the hatchback, the rear lights were changed, so that they appear sharper, and less clumsy. The estate and saloon, (saloon is not available in Britain), also had subtle revisions to their rears too.

Inside, the multitude of buttons on the dashboard have been removed, and replaced by an all-new eight inch touchscreen. The quality of plastics have improved, and the steering wheel is a new three-spoke. Trim levels in the UK consist of Studio, Style, Zetec, Zetec S, Titanium, Titanium X and ST. Trim levels in Europe are similar to the pre-facelift model including Ambiente, Trend, Trend +, Titanium and ST. The new 1.5 TDCi Duratorq diesel (95 and 120&nbsp;hp) and 1.5 Ecoboost (150 and 180&nbsp;hp) has been added to the line-up. The 2.0 TDCi Duratorq diesel has been updated to produce 150 and 185&nbsp;hp.

The new third-generation RS model has been confirmed, with Ford stating that the new RS will now go on sale in 2016. The pricing is rumoured to be below £30,000 and it will have 350 hp. It was revealed in the flesh at the 2015 Geneva Motor Show, and featured at the 2015 Goodwood Festival of Speed.

Mechanical improvements to the facelifted [[Ford Focus]] are chassis revisions to all versions, to make the car more planted on the road, and the steering is also sharper than the pre-facelift model, while also offering greater feedback for greater driving pleasure and fun, which has been the trademark of the Focus since it launched back in 1998.

== Focus ST ==
[[File:Ford Focus - Mondial de l'Automobile de Paris 2012 - 002.jpg|thumb|right|2012–2014 Ford Focus ST]]

Beginning Summer 2012 (UK)/late 2012 in the US, Ford offered a new performance-oriented [[hot hatch]] Focus ST, as first revealed at the [[2010 Paris Motor Show]] and then at the 2011 [[Frankfurt Motor Show]] when more details were announced, including the availability of an estate(wagon) version for European markets, and the possibility of a [[sports sedan]] version for North American markets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.carmagazine.co.uk/News/Search-Results/First-Official-Pictures/Ford-Focus-ST-2012-at-the-Frankfurt-motor-show/|title=Ford Focus ST (2012) at the Frankfurt motor show|publisher=Car Magazine |date=201-09-12 |accessdate=November 24, 2011}}</ref>

The ST features a new, more aggressive exterior design, including a redesigned front bumper with larger air intakes and grille, larger rear wing, wider side sills, center exit exhaust, and alloy wheels. Inside, the car receives a trio of additional gauges mounted in the dashboard, faux-carbon fiber trim, and sport seats with body colored inserts and stitching. The car will be offered three trim options: ST1, ST2 and ST3; the  same three options that were available with the MkII ST.

Differences between the US and European models besides the lack of the wagon model outside Europe and Federally-required amber side reflectors are limited to paint and trim: Euro ST1s get all-cloth Recaro seats while U.S.-spec ST1s use the same seats as the 2012 SE Sport Package; Red seat accents on the Recaro seats are not available on American ST2s; Euro ST3s feature a leather Recaro rear seat setup; The rear headrests are different in each market; Red is the only exterior color included in the base price in Europe while yellow is the only extra-cost color in the U.S.; The optional MyFord Touch system that is fitted to ST2/ST3 models in the U.S. is not offered in Europe; The North American ST utilizes a full-size spare tire while the Euro ST features a mini spare or fix-a-flat setup, depending on what audio system is fitted; The Euro ST offers further options (some grouped in option packages) compared to the North American models including: red brake calipers (standard on all ST trim levels in U.S.), pop-out door guards, heated windshield, lane departure system, and active speed limiter; Headlight washers are fitted to the Euro ST3; Only the ST3 model in the United States features the handbrake, armrest, and cup holder design from the Focus Titanium, while all Euro and Canadian Focus STs have that setup; The Euro Focus ST features a height-adjustable front passenger seat.

The ST will use a {{convert|252|hp|abbr=on}} & {{Convert|366|Nm|lb·ft|abbr=on}} version of the 4-cylinder 2.0L EcoBoost engine, a gain of 25&nbsp;hp above the previous Focus ST which used a larger 2.5L 5-cylinder engine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.insideline.com/ford/focus/2012/2012-ford-focus-st-2010-paris-auto-show.html|title=2010 Ford Focus ST – 2010 Paris Auto Show|publisher=Edmunds Insideline |date=September 15, 2010 |accessdate=September 15, 2010}}</ref> It is resultantly estimated that the ST will reach {{convert|100|km/h}} in 6.5&nbsp;seconds, while its top speed will be {{convert|248|km/h}}. Compared to the previous ST, the new model has the same 0 to 100&nbsp;km/h time and has a 2&nbsp;mph higher top speed. Another significant improvement is weight; the new car is {{convert|30|kg}} lighter than its 5-cylinder powered predecessor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://frankfurt2011.fordmedia.eu/indexNonFlashVersion.htm#|title=2012 Ford Focus ST official specifications released|publisher=media.ford.com |date=201-09-12 |accessdate=September 13, 2011}}</ref>

The ST did feature in the remake of the film ''[[The Sweeney]]'', coming out in September 2012. Ford gave six ST-badged Focuses to the production team.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fordstnation.com/top-stories/49-ford-focus-st-lead-car-sweeney-movie-2012-a.html|title=2012 Ford Focus ST To be lead in Sweeney Movie|publisher=Ford ST Nation |date=November 23, 2011 |accessdate=December 5, 2011}}</ref>{{-}}

=== Facelift (Post-2014) ===

For the facelift for the 2015 model year, the ST will continue with the 250&nbsp;bhp 2.0 litre Ecoboost, in the trim levels ST-1, ST-2 and ST-3. It also remains as a 5-door hatchback, and an estate (wagon). For the first time, a 2.0 litre TDCi Duratorq Diesel engine will debut in the ST to rivals the likes of the Volkswagen Golf GTD and the Seat Leon FR. In the ST it produces 182&nbsp;bhp, and 400 NM of torque. Pricing and badging is the same for both petrol and diesel models.

==Overview==
The '''Ford Fairlane Thunderbolt''' is a limited production, factory experimental, [[drag racing|drag race only]] automobile built by [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] in 1964.  A total of 100 units were produced; forty-nine four-speed and fifty-one automatic, enough to secure the 1964 [[NHRA]] Super Stock title for Ford.<ref>[http://www.angelfire.com/hi/427fairlane/ Thunderbolt fansite at Angelfire.com]</ref><ref>[http://www.musclecarclub.com/musclecars/ford-fairlane/ford-fairlane-history-2.shtml History of the Thunderbolt at Musclecarclub.com]</ref>

Based on the [[Ford Fairlane (Americas)|Fairlane]] and named for a factory experimental Fairlane of 1963, the Thunderbolt combined the light weight of Ford's intermediate-sized body introduced in 1962 with a "high rise" {{convert|427|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 engine with dual [[Holley Performance Products|Holley]] four-barrel carburetors intended for use in the much larger [[Ford Galaxie|Galaxie]].  That engine as used in the Galaxie for [[NASCAR]] racing did well, but the Galaxie was simply too heavy an automobile in stock trim to be drag raced successfully; so-called "lightweight" 427-powered Galaxies were built both for stock car racing as well as drag racing during the 1964 model year, although these cars were not modified to the extent of the Thunderbolt.<ref>http://www.carcraft.com/featuredvehicles/ccrp_0411_1964_ford_galaxie_500/index.html Feature on the 1964 Galaxie lightweight factory race car at Carcraft.com</ref>  As installed in the Thunderbolt, the engine was (like all US cars, due to insurance regulations) conservatively rated at {{Convert|425|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 6000 RPM; estimates placed the actual output was close to {{Convert|600|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}.<ref>http://www.kitcarmag.com/thehistoryof/0411kc_ford_427_cammer/index.html</ref>
<ref>http://www.holmanmoody.com/history.html</ref>
In standard form, the Fairlane was {{convert|12|in|mm|abbr=on}} shorter than a Galaxie, rode on a {{convert|3.5|in|mm|abbr=on}} shorter wheelbase and weighed approximately {{convert|700|lb|kg|abbr=on}}  less.  Installing the [[Ford_FE_engine|Ford FE V8]] in a vehicle intended for an engine no larger than a [[Ford_Windsor_engine|Ford Windsor/Challenger engine]] required major reworking and relocation of the car's front suspension components and the modification and strengthening of the suspension mounting areas.  [[Fiberglass]] doors, hood, front fenders and even the front bumper on the earliest cars along with [[Plexiglas]] side and rear windows aided in weight reduction; the hood with its distinctive raised "teardrop" ram air scoop designed to draw hot air from the engine compartment was pinned in position, eliminating the need for a hood hinges and a latch.  Later cars had aluminum front bumpers in place of the fiberglass unit due to racing regulations.<ref name=hsw/><ref name=r1>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=PGYLpmlt5coC&pg=PA130|pages=130–131|title=Ultimate Performance Cars|author=Richard Gunn|publisher=MotorBooks International|year=2006|isbn=0-7603-2571-5}}</ref>

Racing equipment included tubular [[exhaust header]]s, an electric fuel pump, altered rear suspension with heavy-duty traction control bars and asymmetrical [[leaf spring]]s, heavy-duty trunk-mounted battery, [[locking differential]], auxiliary gauges, special drag race wheels and tires supplied both by [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear]] and [[Mickey Thompson]] (himself a recipient of one of the first ten cars) and an aluminum scatter shield designed to contain the clutch in case of disintegration under load.  The claimed [[compression ratio]] was 13.5:1.<ref name=hsw>[http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1964-ford-fairlane-thunderbolt.htm Article on the 1964 Thunderbolt at Howstuffworks.com]</ref><ref>[http://www.conceptcarz.com/vehicle/z15643/Ford-Thunderbolt.aspx History of the Thunderbolt at Conceptcarz.com]</ref>
 
Other weight-saving measures included the elimination of such street items as the sunvisors, radio, heater, wheel covers, passenger side windshield wiper, arm rests, rear window cranks, mirrors, sound deadening material, carpeting, trunk mat, lug wrench, jack and spare tire.  Front seats were either lightweight units from Ford's police package vehicles or rudimentary bucket seats from the [[Ford Econoline|Econoline]] van; the carpeting was replaced by a black rubber mat.  The rear seat was a standard Fairlane unit.  The high-beam headlights were eliminated as well and in their place were mesh-covered air intakes which ran directly to a special air cleaner atop the 427.  Like the street version, the Thunderbolt's outer high/low 5.75&nbsp;inch (146&nbsp;mm) headlights of the type normally used with a four-lamp system were selectable with a standard foot-operated switch.  Though it was technically a street legal automobile, these modifications and deletions along with a final drive ratio of 4:57.1 for the four-speed cars and 4:44.1 for the automatics made the Thunderbolt impractical for street use.  

The Thunderbolt was not built on a regular Ford assembly line, but rather in conjunction with Andy Hotton of Dearborn Steel Tubing.  It was there that partially built Fairlane bodies in top-of-the-line "500" exterior trim were combined with the 427 and either a heavy-duty [[Lincoln (automobile)|Lincoln]] automatic transmission  or a [[Borg-Warner]] four-speed manual transmission.  The first eleven cars were painted in Ford's "Vintage Burgundy" while the remaining eighty-nine cars were painted "Wimbledon White."  The engine code reflected not the 427 on most cars but rather the so-called "K-code" [[tappet|solid lifter]] 289 hi- performance engine..<ref>http://www.hotrod.com/featuredvehicles/hrdp_0911_ford_thunderbolt_reunion/index.html Article on the reunion of surviving Thunderbolts at Hotrod.com</ref> 

Given the special nature of the car, Ford riveted a metal plate to the inside of the glovebox door of the Thunderbolt and other race-only models with a disclaimer relating to fit and finish.  The plate read:

::''This vehicle has been built specially as a lightweight competitive car and includes certain fiberglass and aluminium components.  Because of the specialized purpose for which this car has been built and in order to achieve maximum weight reduction, normal quality standards of the Ford Motor Company in terms of exterior panel fit and surface appearance are not met on this vehicle.''

::''This information is included on this vehicle to assure that all customers who purchase this car are aware of the deviation from the regular high appearance quality standards of the Ford Motor Company.'' <ref>[http://www.hotrod.com/featuredvehicles/hrdp_0001_1964_ford_thunderbolt/index.html Reprint of January 2000 article in ''Hot Rod'' Magazine describing the disclaimer plate on a Thunderbolt used on a road tour]</ref><ref>[http://www.1964ford.com/lightweight.aspx History of the lightweight 1964 Ford drag cars at 1964ford.com]</ref>

The '''Elfin  Type 100 Mono''' is an [[Australian 1½ Litre Formula]] racing car produced from 1964-1969 by [[Elfin Sports Cars]]. The name "Mono" refers to the fact that it was constructed upon a [[monocoque]] design.

==Development==
[[File:Elfin Mono Type 100.jpg|thumb|left|Elfin Type 100 Mono at the National Motor Museum at Birdwood in [[South Australia]]]]
In 1963, [[Garrie Cooper]] began work on a revolutionary [[monocoque]] design of a car intended to dominate the newly created [[Australian 1½ Litre Formula|Australian 1½ Litre capacity class]]. [[Lotus Cars]] had already built the Formula 1 monocoque under the direction of [[Colin Chapman]] but the idea was still in its infancy so [[Garrie Cooper|Cooper]] had only vague ideas of the design. The [[monocoque]] build removed the need for the traditional [[Superleggera|"Superleggera" tube frame chassis]] and harnessed a very light sheet steel frame to which aluminum panels were riveted for a very stiff structure. The finished structure weighed approximately 80&nbsp;kg less than the [[Superleggera|tube framed]] [[Elfin Catalina]] it replaced. Uniquely, the hollow section of the body was sealed off to serve as the petrol tank. The Elfin Mono eventually made its debut at the August 1964 Melbourne Racing Car show and orders quickly followed.<ref>http://melbourneclassics.com/files/THREE_AUSTRALIAN_GPs.pdf</ref>

'''VIAC''', the '''VisLab Intercontinental Autonomous Challenge''', is the challenge conceived by [[VisLab]] as an extreme test of [[Intelligent car|autonomous vehicles]].  It ran from July 20, 2010 to October 28, 2010, involving four [[driverless car|driverless vehicles]] driving with 
virtually no human intervention on an almost {{convert|16000|km|mi}} trip from [[Parma]], [[Italy]] to [[Shanghai]], [[China]].<ref name="VIAC">{{cite web|author=webmaster@ce.unipr.it |url=http://vislab.it/Projects/view/32/VisLab%27s_adventure_on_the_Silk_road |title=VisLab's Adventure on the Silk Road |publisher=Vislab.it |date=2009-10-29 |accessdate=2010-11-19}}</ref><ref name=done>[http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/A/AS_CHINA_EU_DRIVERLESS_VEHICLE?SITE=VASTR&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT "Without driver or map, vans go from Italy to China"], Elaine Kurtenbac, AP.COM</ref>
<ref name=cnn>[http://edition.cnn.com/2010/TECH/innovation/10/27/driverless.car/index.html?iref=allsearch "Driverless van crosses from Europe to Asia"], Jo Ling Kent, CNN.COM</ref>

==Overview==
The [[Expo 2010 Shanghai China|2010 World Expo]]'s theme was “better cities, better life”; therefore issues related to sustainable mobility were central to the Expo and this challenge of reaching Shanghai with driverless vehicles provided a clear demonstration of future vehicles; it is considered one of the main milestones in [[Robotics]].

[[VisLab]], thanks to a  project partially funded by ERC -the [[European Research Council]]- showed that one day it will be possible to move goods between two continents with non-polluting vehicles powered by green energy and with virtually no human intervention. Goods were packed in [[Parma]] and taken to [[Shanghai]] on driverless vehicles for the first time in history.

==The idea==
The aim was to test and stress the current technology in a unique event:  non-polluting and non-oil based [[Driverless car|autonomous vehicles]] in real traffic conditions on an extreme journey between two continents, the final outcome being a huge dataset with a very large variety of situations to be further used to refine the onboard perception system.

==Technical details==
The trip traversed remote areas in Russia, Kazakhstan, and China, for which no map was available; due to the length of the trip it was also impossible to check and test the route in advance. Therefore VisLab defined the following behavior.

The first vehicle drove autonomously in selected sections of the trip, conducting experimental tests on [[sensor|sensing]],  [[decision making software|decision]], and [[Control system|control]] subsystems, and continuously collecting data. Human interventions were needed on a regular basis to define the route and intervene in critical situations.

The second vehicle automatically followed the route defined by the leader vehicle by following it either visually or thanks to GPS waypoints sent by the leader vehicle, therefore requiring no human intervention (100% autonomous). This is regarded as a readily exploitable vehicle, able to move on predefined routes. 

During the trip, demonstrations were scheduled in specific hot spots, showing autonomous vehicles following given routes, negotiating traffic, avoiding obstacles, and stopping when required. The first demonstration was held in [[Rome]] at the EUR district on October 29, 2009, when Rome's Major, [[Gianni Alemanno]], officially presented the VIAC challenge.
The last demonstration was given exactly one year later, on Oct 28, 2010, in [[Shanghai]], [[China]], during a parade at the World Expo, organized by the European Pavilion.

Although the vehicles were electric and had solar panels on the roof, propulsion was not powered by the solar panels but by the original vehicle's batteries which were charged at power outlets or, when no power outlet was available,  by generators. The solar panels powered the autonomous driving system (sensors, processing engines, actuators, radios, GPS,..).<ref name="VIAC_FAQ">{{cite web|url=http://viac.vislab.it/?page_id=155 |title=Challenge FAQ |publisher=Viac.vislab.it |date=2010-10-26 |accessdate=2010-11-19}}</ref>

==Worldwide Milestone and Data Analysis==
The VisLab Intercontinental Autonomous Challenge is considered a unique milestone in vehicular robotics, just like the [[DARPA Grand Challenge]] in 2005 and the [[DARPA Urban Challenge]] in 2007. The vehicles collected about 50 terabytes of data to be used in the future for further processing off-line.

==Organization and Logistics==
The logistics were managed by Overland Network, which provided 4 RVs (motor homes) and 3 additional trucks as a support. The expedition was therefore formed by 4 autonomous vehicles, 4 RVs, 3 trucks, and occupied about 20 people for three months.  A satellite link broadcast live data and video streaming for the whole duration of the trip (except in China) so that everybody on the Internet was able to witness the progress of the experiment.

There are several ways to charge the battery:
* using 10A 220V-240V household [[mains power]] from a standard electrical outlet in 10–12 hours
* using 16A with a 3&nbsp;kW public charge spot or specifically installed home charging spot in 6–9 hours
* the battery uses a "QuickDrop" system that allows it to be quickly switched for a charged battery at a dedicated battery exchange facility.

The Fluence Z.E. uses a [[synchronous motor|synchronous electric motor]] with rotor coil, weighing {{convert|160|kg|abbr=on}}. Its peak power is {{convert|70|kW|abbr=on}} at 11,000rpm, while maximum torque is {{convert|226|Nm|abbr=on}}.<ref name =GCC0410/><ref name=RenaultZE/>

The Fluences uses a PRND gate selector as well as providing a small amount of creep in 'D' to emulate the behaviour of traditional internal combustion engine equipped [[automatic transmission]] cars.

Better Place customers needed only to drive up to the entrance of a [[Battery swapping|battery switch station]] to start the switch process. The Oscar in-car navigation system uses a WiFi connection to communicate with the station's computers and an RFID tag on the windscreen of the subscriber's car identifies it. The barrier opens and the customer drives up to a mark. The dashboard screen and external monitors then give instructions to select Neutral and turn off the ignition.
The remaining process is fully automated, similar to going through a [[car wash]], so the driver never has to leave the car. In just a few minutes, a robot beneath the car removes the depleted battery and replaces it with a full one. Once complete, instruction is given to restart the car and an exit barrier lifts.<ref name=GCC0611/>

After implementing the first modern commercial deployment of the battery swapping model in Israel and Denmark, Better Place filed for [[bankruptcy]] in Israel in May 2013. The company's financial difficulties were caused by the high investment required to develop the charging and swapping infrastructure, about {{USD|850}} million in private capital, and a market penetration significantly lower than originally predicted by Shai Agassi.Less than 1,000 Fluence Z.E.s were deployed in Israel and around 400 units in Denmark through May 2013.<ref name=NYT052613>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/27/business/global/israeli-electric-car-company-files-for-liquidation.html?_r=0|title=Israeli Venture Meant to Serve Electric Cars Is Ending Its Run|author=Isabel Kershner|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=2013-05-26|accessdate=2013-05-27}}</ref><ref name=JPost052613>{{cite news|url=http://www.jpost.com/Business/Business-News/Death-of-Better-Place-Electric-car-co-to-dissolve-314380|title=Death of Better Place: Electric car co. to dissolve |author=Niv Elis|work=[[The Jerusalem Post]]|date=2013-05-26|accessdate=2013-05-30}}</ref>

The electric car was scheduled to go on sale to the public from a number of dealers across the country in the fourth quarter of 2012. Better Place explained that delays in the deployments in Israel and Denmark reflected in the Australian roll out, which would take place between 12 to 18 months behind the other markets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.caradvice.com.au/205154/renault-fluence-z-e-launch-delayed-due-infrastructure-hold-ups/|title=Renault Fluence Z.E. launch delayed due to infrastructure hold-ups |author=Tim Beissmann |publisher=Car Advice|date=2012-12-13|accessdate=2012-12-19}}</ref> However, Better Place filed for bankruptcy in May 2013.<ref name=NYT052613/>

'''Slot.it Challenge''' is a UK [[slot racing]] championship sponsored by Slot.it and Pendle Slot Racing and held between April and November since 2006.

==Format==
The format of the championship has never changed since the start in 2006. With the race event always held on a Sunday, the Saturday is used as timed practice for visiting drivers, with home drivers not allowed to practice on the Saturday. The hosting venue also holds a meal at the most popular and closest hotel to the track on the Saturday evening after practice. For racing every driver does a three minute stint on every lane. Then these laps totaled to give an overall position, and these positions used to determine what lane a driver will be on for step-up finals. The winning driver after the step up finals is awarded fifty points, with the second driver taking forty-nine points etc. This was the same for the juniors up until the end of the 2008 season, from then on the juniors winning points were reduced to twenty points with the second junior taking nineteen points etc.

At the end of the season, if a driver has completed all the events then his worst round will be erased, with a driver competing in all but one event keeping all his points.

==Venues==
The starting venue since 2007, Pinewood only held the one event on its "old" track in 2007. Since it got a new 105&nbsp;ft, gloss surfaced track in 2008. This track has always been one of the hardest to master within the racing weekend. The tracks main features are a very short start, a high-speed banked 180 degree corner and a technical and challenging section top section of track. In the first season of racing, the winning pace was completing 24.4 laps within the three minutes. However, in 2010, the winning pace is now up to 28.7 laps within three minutes, giving an average lap time increase of 1.1 seconds over 3 minutes.

In 2002, DARPA announced the first Grand Challenge: "Build a robotic vehicle able to travel unassisted on a predefined path of about 130 miles through the Mojave Desert. The fastest robot to navigate the course in less than 10 hours will take home $1 million." The first competition was scheduled in March 2004.

After learning of the Challenge in 2003, a small group of [[UL Lafayette]] students and professors joined together to see if they could take on the task of designing a completely autonomous vehicle.<ref name="DesertDerby">{{cite news|url = http://www.cnn.com/2004/TECH/ptech/03/09/darpa.race/index.html|title = Desert derby to find top battlefield bot|accessdate = 2010-04-23|last = |authorlink = | work=CNN | date=2004-03-10}}</ref> "GPS Bot" was engineered as a proof-of-concept, using a small remote controlled car coupled with a micro controller and GPS sensor.

Building on the success of previous challenges, DARPA has launched a new competition, dubbed the "Urban Challenge". The event took place in November 2007, set in Victorville, California.

The Urban Challenge required teams "to build a robotic vehicle that can operate in urban traffic, finding its own path while also following traffic rules".

Each team was provided a GPS map of an urban cityscape, simulating military supply missions in an urban setting. Traveling among manned and robotic vehicle traffic, the team vehicles traveled through required points in the mock city. Teams were required to complete the 60-mile course safely in less than six hours.<ref name="CajunBotHistory2007">{{cite web|url = http://cajunbot.com/history/urban-challenge-2007|title = Urban Challenge 2007 (CajunBot History)|accessdate = 2010-04-18|last = |authorlink = |year = }}</ref>

The '''Avanti''' is an American performance [[sports coupe]] based on the [[Studebaker Avanti]] and produced by a succession of five different ownership arrangements. After the closure of [[Studebaker]]'s [[South Bend]] factory on December 20, 1963, cars with the name Avanti were initially produced from left-over Studebaker components and later from [[General Motors]] and [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] chassis and engines. These are not replica cars, for they were made by '''Avanti Motor Company'''. 

==Altman and Newman==
[[File:1976 Avanti II (Rahmi M. Koç Müzesi).jpg|thumb|1976 Avanti II]]
After Studebaker ended production at South Bend, the "Avanti" model name, tooling, Studebaker truck production rights and parts and plant space were bought by local Studebaker dealers, Nate and Arnold Altman and Leo Newman, who incorporated as Avanti Motor Corporation and hand-built a small number of cars.<ref>[[#Langworth|Langworth]], p. 278</ref> Leo Newman ran the Studebaker truck parts division which enabled the company to be profitable at its outset. According to Stu Chapman, Studebaker Director of Advertising & Public Relations 1964-1966, in his book 'My Father The Car: Memoirs Of My Life With Studebaker', there was talk with Studebaker of reintroducing the Avanti to Studebaker showrooms in 1965/66, along with ambitious plans for rebadging an [[Isuzu Bellett]] as an entry level Studebaker, and combining with Canadian Motor Industries. This would have taken control and production away from the South Bend board who at the time was determined to discontinue auto production no matter that Studebaker was the only car company in history to discontinue a make that was still profitable.

The Altman brothers introduced a slightly modified version of the car in 1965 under the brand name "Avanti II".<ref>[[#Langworth|Langworth]], p. 257</ref> which initially had a 327-in³ (5.4 L) [[Chevrolet Corvette]] engine.

The Avanti Motor Company was re-purchased by [[Michael Eugene Kelly]]. He moved the production to Ohio in 1987.
 
The company had the  second-generation Avanti's styling originated by Tom Kellogg, the youngest member of the original Avanti Studebaker design team, at first called the AVX in the mid 90's. Tom Kellogg was fatally injured in a car accident in California on August 14, 2003.<ref>{{cite news|last=Martin |first=Douglas |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/19/business/thomas-w-kellogg-71-a-studebaker-avanti-designer.html?pagewanted=al|title=Thomas W.

==Cafaro years==
[[File:1991 Avanti II sedan.jpg|thumb|1991 Avanti four-door sedan]]
Real estate man John J. Cafaro purchased the rights to Avanti Motor Company in 1988. With the help of the State of Ohio, he moved all Avanti production from South Bend - its birthplace - to the [[Rust Belt]] area of [[Youngstown, Ohio]]. In 1988 and 1989 Avanti made two-door coupes and a convertible. The 1988 Avanti were called the "Silver Year" models, marking 25 years since the Avanti's introduction. The 1989 Avanti were given a ground effects packaging.

Cafaro was noted for making the four door Avanti in 1990, an idea from the original designer, Raymond Loewy.{{cn|date=August 2015}} Cafaro concentrated on the four door to the detriment of the original coupe, the company's primary vehicle. Only 90 were made at the Youngstown plant. In 1991 Cafaro went back to building the convertible before the plant was closed later that year.

==Michael E. Kelly returns==
M. E. Kelly moved Avanti operations from Ohio to Georgia in 1999 and produced redesigned Avanti automobiles in [[Villa Rica, Georgia]] from 2000 to 2005, before moving to [[Cancun, Mexico]]. 
From 2004, [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] chassis and engines were used. In October 2005 an internet report said "Avanti Motors" had "recently announced a new relationship with Ford Motor Company and was planning a big comeback".<ref>Spinelli M, [http://jalopnik.com/cars/news/game-on-avanti-motors-hopes-to-survive-and-thrive-in-2006-130353.php Game On: Avanti Motors Hopes to Survive and Thrive in 2006] at jalopnik.com, October 11, 2005</ref>  An internet report in 2006 said Kelly had sold the company in 1988 and repurchased it in 1999 from Cafaro of Ohio; and that the company had established a new factory and showroom in [[Villa Rica]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. In early 2006, Kelly moved Avanti production to a new plant in [[Cancun]], [[Mexico]], but the company floundered after M. E. Kelly was arrested in December 2006 on fraud counts related to an alleged  [[ponzi scheme]] in the United States.

The last Avanti to date rolled off the line in Cancun, Mexico in March of 2006. All the Mustang-based Avantis used V-8 engines, with the option of a Ford V-6. Only one 2006 Avanti was built with a Ford V-6 engine.  The factory and showroom were emptied in 2011 and have been sold. Many extremely rare Studebaker and Avanti concepts and racing vehicles that were on the second floor of the building in Cancun have been moved elsewhere and/or sold.<ref>{{cite web

The '''BAR 004''' was the car with which the [[British American Racing]] team competed in the {{F1|2002}} [[Formula One]] season. It was driven by [[Jacques Villeneuve]] and [[Olivier Panis]].

During the season the car was unreliable having a dismal start which saw the team fail to score a single championship point during the first half of the season. Also Olivier Panis failed to finish the first seven races. The team scored their first points when they finished fourth and fifth at the [[2002 British Grand Prix]] at [[Silverstone Circuit|Silverstone]]. Eventually the team finished eighth in the Constructors' Championship with 7 points.

The '''Aston Martin RHAM/1''' was a highly modified Aston Martin DBS V8 racing car, developed by [[Robin Hamilton (racing driver)|Robin Hamilton]], built with the intention of racing at the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]]. After development by Hamilton, RHAM/1 competed in the [[1977 24 Hours of Le Mans|1977]] and [[1979 24 Hours of Le Mans]], finishing 17th overall and 3rd in the [[IMSA GT Championship#The GTP Era|GTP]] class in the 1977 race. The car has also held the [[World Land Speed Record]], for towing a caravan, at the speed of 124.91&nbsp;mph.

== Design ==

After completing his apprenticeship with Rolls Royce in [[Derby]], Robin Hamilton set up Robin Hamilton Motors in Tutbry with David Jack. At Robin Hamilton Motors they specialised solely in [[Aston Martin]]s. Hamilton gained large experience with [[Aston Martin]] [[DBS V8]]'s and AM V8's while at the specialist. Hamilton's [[DBS V8]] (DBSV8/10038/RC) was only the second ever production [[Aston Martin V8]] to take to the track. Competing on 6 April 1974, with the first raced V8 being a DBS V8 in 1970 at the [[Aston Martin Owners Club|AMOC]] Curborough Sprint.

With Hamilton's experience DBSV8/10038/RC was developed and developed and after large modifications to the car over the three years of 1974 to 1977, the car became unrecognisable and the original chassis number of DBSV8/10038/RC, was changed to RHAM/1 (Robin Hamilton Aston Martin #1). Which was the car that would finally fulfil Hamilton's intentions of racing at [[Le Mans]].

Whilst this is not a works car, support was provided by the Aston Martin factory, and indeed lessons learned from the [[Motor Industry Research Association|MIRA]] wind tunnel test sessions were applied to the [[Aston Martin V8|V8 Vantage]] in the form of front air dam and rear spoiler.

== Racing History ==

=== 1974 ===

In 1974, Staffordshire based Aston Martin specialist, [[Robin Hamilton (racing driver)|Robin Hamilton]] began competing a lightly modified 1969 DBS V8 (DBS/10038/RC) in [[Aston Martin Owners Club]] events. The first major alterations that were made to 10038/RC were made to make the car conform to Group 4 regulations and bring the car into line with the then current production AM V8 by fitting the latter's single headlight AM V8 front end.

To make the Le Mans dreams possible the Aston Martin V8 was [[Homologation|homologated]] for racing, which involved registering the car with both the [[Motor Sports Association|RAC MSA]] (now [[Motor Sports Association|MSA]]) and the [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]].

=== 1975 ===

Due to the large modifications to the aerodynamics of the car, DBSV8/10038/RC was not usable on the roads. At this stage the car was far quicker than any standard DBS V8, however only shared similar power outputs to the production V8 Vantage.

With [[Le Mans]] the eventual target, the car was further developed to incorporate modified cylinder heads, revised camshafts, side-draft [[Weber carburetor|Weber]] carburettors and a race exhaust system, while the suspension and brakes were also upgraded, with stiffer and shorter springs, larger brakes, wider wheels and racing slick tyres. In this form DBSV8/10038/RC raced in [[Aston Martin Owners Club|AMOC]] events throughout 1975, competing up until September 1975. The car showed promise, proving to be a match for former [[Le Mans]] cars at the AMOC [[Silverstone Circuit|Silverstone]] meeting in July by finishing 3rd. Later that year, the car gained a quartet of dragster-style downdraft Weber carburettors, which were the height of half the [[Windshield|windscreen]] for the 1976 season.

=== 1976 ===

The DBS V8 appeared at the Jaguar Drivers Club meeting in April 1976 as after it had undergone wind tunnel testing at [[Motor Industry Research Association|MIRA]] (through backing from [[Aston Martin]]). The car's power output had not tested on a [[dynamometer]], nor a rolling road, with the only testing being held on straight stretch of {{convert|3|mi|km}} of local public road.

The car only completed half of the events in 1976 due to the preparation for the scheduled [[Le Mans]] appearance. [[Robin Hamilton (racing driver)|Robin Hamilton]] hoped to race at the [[1976 24 Hours of Le Mans|1976 Le Mans race]], even preparing a sponsorship brochure, seeking financial support. With the brochure saying: "''The Aston Martin will run in Group 4, and although it is unlikely to finish 1st overall, stands an excellent chance of winning this Group, which would carry almost as much prestige as winning the race overall.''"<ref>Chudecki, Paul: Aston Martin V8 Race Cars, page 39, 1990</ref> In the personnel list, famous [[Aston Martin]] team manager [[John Wyer]] was listed as project consultant and [[Willie Green (racing driver)|Willie Green]] as second driver, with the third driver to be announced.

Fred Hartley, an interim managing director at Aston Martin in 1976, had promised assistance to Hamilton, via a letter to him. But this financial assistance, nor a sponsor was found and the car did not go to the 1976 Le Mans race but this was probably a good Oman, as according to Hamilton, "''Actually it was just as well, because I don't think we would have been ready for it''." <ref>Chudecki, Paul: Aston Martin V8 Race Cars, page 36, 1990</ref>

In November/December 1976 Hamilton was allowed 2 weeks of testing on the engine test-bed facilities at Aston Martin's Newport Pagnell factory . With liaison from Dave Morgan (experienced with Lola-Astons of the 1960s and later the Aston Martin Nimrod V8's), there was small development with the engine and "''suggestions about carburettors and bell-mouths''."<ref>Chudecki, Paul: Aston Martin V8 Race Cars, page 37, 1990</ref>

Robin Hamilton went back to the Aston Martin Factory for financial backing (£20,000) for the project, suggesting an idea, for production of a powerful 380-{{convert|400|bhp|abbr=on}} limited edition [[Aston Martin V8]]. His idea being to increase the sale price by £1000, this £1000 funding his project. Aston Martin dismissed the idea, even though Hamilton had made drawings of the proposed car. In 1977 [[Aston Martin]] went on to introduce the [[Aston Martin V8 Vantage (1977)|V8 Vantage]], similar to Hamiltons idea, but only coincidental.

Robin Hamilton got assistance from Mike Loasby, who paid for a wind tunnel test session. In which they made the spoiler and other pieces to make the Vantage. The car saw a 10% reduction in drag and increased downforce bodywork. The car now almost had the same body shape as the Vantage. All efforts were then put into making the 1976 24 Hours of Le Mans and a sponsor would eventually found.

=== 1977 Le Mans 24 Hour ===

[[Robin Hamilton (racing driver)|Robin Hamilton]] again released a sponsorship brochure for 1977, but again failed to get any large sponsorship backing. But Hamilton did gain a small sponsorship deal from SAS in London, a company who specialised in riot and security equipment. Hamilton received £25,000, which covered most of his costs for [[Le Mans]].

The V8 engine of the car, had now been fitted with Nimonic steel valves, special forged [[Cosworth]] pistons and a redesigned sump. The engine would now produce {{convert|520|bhp|abbr=on}} at 6,750 rpm and 381&nbsp;bhp at the wheels. Plus over 400&nbsp;ft·lbf of torque at 5,250 rpm with [[Weber carburetor|Weber]] 50 IDA downdraught carburettors. The car by this stage was now a [[Group 5 (racing)|Group 5]] car rather than a [[Group 4 (racing)|Group 4]], which would mean it would have to race against the [[Turbocharger|turbocharged]] [[Porsche]]s. Another [[wind tunnel]] test showed that the car would have dangerous amounts of lift on the [[Mulsanne Straight]], so another change had to be made, and a rear tail spoiler needed to be fitted. The wind tunnel test also showed that the [[Radiator (engine cooling)|radiator]], (now moved to the back to change the weight bias), would gain then 10&nbsp;mph more in top speed, but it would cause the engine to run too hot, so it had to be moved back to its original location. Four oil coolers also ensured that the engine temperature never exceeded 110&nbsp;°C.

The car also had other modifications made to it, with a redesign of the front bulkhead and mostly drilled box section included in the chassis modifications. RHAM/1 also had roller bearing drive shafts and peg-drive centre lock hubs for the one piece custom made [[BBS Kraftfahrzeugtechnik AG|BBS]] [[Alloy wheel|magnesium wheels]]. The wheels measured 19" in diameter, 15" wide at the rear, and 13" wide at the front and had special, custom made [[Dunlop Tyres|Dunlop tyres]] for them. The wheels themselves needed to be bigger than 16" to go over the twin [[Disc brake#Calipers|caliper]], 12½" Lockheed, ventilated [[disc brake]]s, with no servo assistance. All of which was needed to stop the 30 [[Centum weight|cwt]] [[Aston Martin]]. The alternator was switched to run off the gearbox (which itself had a closer ratio 5th gear) instead of the engine crankshaft. The clutch was now uprated to a triple plate. The suspension was almost standard, with standard rubber bushes but with slight geometry changes. Nylon mountings were also used for a reduced width Dion tube. The [[roll cage]] was a [[NASCAR]] (instead of [[FIA]]) specification cage, which was bolted to the chassis. This alone weighed 50&nbsp;kg.

The car by then became known as RHAM/1 (its chassis number, Robin Hamilton Aston Martin #1) as it was unrecognisable from the original car. RHAM/1 made its debut at the [[Silverstone Circuit|Silverstone]] Six Hours<ref name="Complete Archive of Chassis RHAM/1">{{cite web|url=http://www.racingsportscars.com/chassis/archive/RHAM__001.html|title=Complete Archive of Chassis RHAM/1|publisher=Racing Sports Cars}}</ref> a pre event to the Le Mans race, on 15 May 1977. By this time Hamilton had gained some financial input from several [[Aston Martin Owners Club|AMOC]] members, whose names appeared on the rear wing for the race. At the Six Hour race, Hamilton drove alongside fellow AMOC member [[David Preece (racing driver)|David Preece]]. In practice Preece spun off, but not a lot of damage was caused to the car. RHAM/1 qualified on the eight row, in 1 minute 43.39 seconds. During the race, Le Mans gearing ratios and a rev limiter of 6,000 rpm meant the car lost over 100&nbsp;bhp. At a pit stop, heat soak from the in board rear brakes caused the differential oil seal to fail and 55 minutes were lost in the stop. Due to the regulations saying that they could not change the unit, they had to repair it. In order to save more complications, and to finish the race, the car raced on at a much slower pace. Hamilton and Preece did finish, but they failed to reach the final standings due to insufficient laps completed.

After the race, Hamilton had to modify the cooling of the rear brakes, otherwise the car would never last the 24-hour period.

RHAM/1 competed in its first 24 Hour event when it raced at the [[1977 24 Hours of Le Mans|1977 Le Mans 24 hour]] race.<ref name="Complete Archive of Chassis RHAM/1"/> With drivers David Preece, [[Mike Salmon (racing driver)|Mike Salmon]] (a Le Mans veteran, Salmon had driven the last Aston to race at the Sarthe, Peter Sutcliffe's [[Aston Martin DP214]], in 1964.) and Robin Hamilton himself. A request was made to move to the [[IMSA GT Championship#The GTP Era|GTP]] category (from the competitive Group 5, where opposition was deemed less strong. This request was granted by the organisers.

The first practice was a wet session, and all drivers came accustomed to the wet conditions. With RHAM/1 putting in respectable lap times, being assisted by good tyre grip with the aid of huge 1516&nbsp;kg weight of the car (heaviest by 5½ [[Centum weight|cwt]]). The fastest time would have put them in the middle of the grid. In the next practice session the car ran with both [[Radiator (engine cooling)|radiator]] ducts open, which aided cooling down to 85&nbsp;°C, but gave the effect which was likened to losing a cylinder on the Mulsanne Straight, due to the increased drag. In the last hours of qualifying, Hamilton had to put in quick laps in the dark, in order to make the cut for the race. Hamilton put in a best time of 4 minutes 31.8 seconds, With the V8 engine producing 520&nbsp;bhp, RHAM/1 was recorded at 188&nbsp;mph on the Mulsanne Straight during qualifying. Hamiltons time was well inside the 4 minutes 48 seconds maximum time, however this was the slowest in the GTP class. The organisers for the race, then decided to reduce the field to 55 cars, which meant losing the slowest car in each class, which would have meant RHAM/1 would have been dropped. But one of the other GTP class racers had broken the rules and were cut instead, to the relief of Hamilton who only found out 5 hours before the race.

In the race itself, the car started with a lower front spoiler to aid stability, but this lost the car 10&nbsp;mph in top speed. Hamilton drove the opening stint, but came into the pits after 11 minutes with brake vibration, but this was down to the brakes bedding in. Hamilton's stint was followed by Preece and then Salmon, with the Aston picking up 23 places in 2 hours. The Aston's fuel efficiency was good, better than first thought after the [[Silverstone Circuit|Silverstone]] Six Hour race, but this could have been improved, as GTP rules allowed for a 160 litre fuel tank to be used compared to the Aston's installed 120 litre tank to meet Group 5 regulations. But this could not be changed before the race.

At a routine stop at 10.19pm, cracks in the front brake discs were discovered. They were replaced in a pit stop lasting 31 minutes, but a lack of further spares meant that they had to reduce the use of the brakes and therefore use engine braking as much as possible for the remaining 17 hours and 41 minutes. Even so lap times remained constant. The only other serious problem encountered was a split differential oil tank that needed regular patching and topping up resulting in one 27 minute pit stop. A few more problems had to be deal with before the end of the race, with a 2 minute stop having to be made to reset the lights on the car. Also the gear lever had to be replaced after Salmon broke it off and threw it out of the window during one of his stints. A marshal collected the gear knob and returned it to the garage, running all the way from his post.

Running steadily to the flag, the Aston Martin crossed the finish line after 2,210.78 miles (261 laps) of racing with Robin Hamilton, who had driven longest of the three drivers, at the wheel. RHAM/1 finished in 17th place overall (from 55 starters) and 3rd in class (GTP category), ironically, if it had stayed in Group 5 it would have finished 2nd in class. Pit stops totalled 3 hours and fuel consumption worked out at 5.75 [[Miles per gallon|mpg]]. With RHAM/1 using a maximum engine speed of 6,400 rpm, averaging 92.12&nbsp;mph (including stops) or 104.70&nbsp;mph (excluding stops). The fastest lap in the car was by Hamilton, recording 4 minutes 34.2 seconds (average speed of 112.25&nbsp;mph). 18 of the 24 hours were driven with cracked front brake discs, the car was later given the name of 'Muncher' due to the rate that the car got through brake discs.

Hamilton achieved a lifelong ambition by driving an Aston Martin across the Le Mans finishing line and also confounded the pundits who claimed that the heavyweight [[Aston Martin DBS|DBS V8]] was totally unsuitable for racing.

=== 1978 ===

For 1978, RHAM/1 was modified even more, now with and output of {{convert|800|bhp|abbr=on}} assisted by twin [[Garrett AiResearch]] turbos. But, fuel consumption dropped to 2.5 [[Miles per gallon|mpg]] (for the 1977 race, the average was 5.75 mpg) so the entry to [[Le Mans]] was withdrawn two weeks prior the race.<ref name="Complete Archive of Chassis RHAM/1"/>

=== 1979 Le Mans 24 Hour ===

RHAM/1 next appeared at the [[Silverstone Circuit|Silverstone]] Six Hours<ref name="Complete Archive of Chassis RHAM/1"/> in May 1979, considerably lightened and re-modeled with a lower roof line, steeply raked windscreen, huge front air dam and dropped bonnet line. While beneath the bonnet was a twin-turbocharged version of the Aston V8 engine with fuel injection in place of the [[Weber carburetor|Weber carburettors]], reducing boost pressure to give maximum power output of {{convert|650|bhp|abbr=on}} in race specification. But this reduced fuel consumption to around 4 [[Miles per gallon|mpg]]. The brakes were enlarged again, to 13" all round and water cooling was developed to help cool them (to be used at [[Le Mans]]). 350&nbsp;lb in weight was also removed, in non Le Mans trim (no extra lights or equipment).

For the race at Silverstone Hamilton was joined by [[David Preece (racing driver)|David Preece]] and [[Derek Bell (auto racer)|Derek Bell]], but Hamilton would not race, only working in the pits. After a De Dion tube in the rear suspensison broke whilst Hamilton was driving in the practice. The car qualified 11th out of 25 entrants, with Bell recording 1 minute 37.54 seconds. In the race the car suffered trouble with brake fade and oil breathing problems, the car dropped down to 21st place after 1 hour 30 minutes, but back up to 17th after 3 hours. RHAM/1 finished 13th overall and 6th in class, after being hampered with more problems, of a blown tyre and small engine fire.

Hamilton received sponsorshop for the [[1979 24 Hours of Le Mans|1979 Le Mans 24 hour]]<ref name="Complete Archive of Chassis RHAM/1"/> from fellow [[Aston Martin Owners Club|AMOC]] member, Peter Millward through his company Link Systems. The car would again compete in the [[IMSA GT Championship#The GTP Era|GTP]] class, weighing 1,546&nbsp;kg it was again the heaviest in the class. Before the race the gearbox and engine were changed due to not being able to select first gear. During the race (with the same set of drivers as Silverstone that year) the V8 proved capable of lapping many seconds quicker than in 1977 (7.32 seconds). But the car suffered more problems, with an ongoing oil leak and then, after it had only competed 2 hours and 45 minutes (21 laps) of the race, a connecting rod broke due to a melted and holed piston.

=== 1980 ===

The car's next race, was at [[Silverstone Circuit|Silverstone]] Six Hours<ref name="Complete Archive of Chassis RHAM/1"/> in 1980, where RHAM/1 now had a huge rear wing to counterbalance the downforce at the front of the car. Driven by Hamilton and Bell, the car retired early, as after just {{convert|61.5|mi|km}}, when the rear hub failed.

On 14 October 1980 RHAM/1 set a new [[Land speed record|World Land Speed Record]] for towing a caravan on the runway at [[RAF Elvington|Elvington Airfield]], Yorkshire. Robin Hamilton towed an Alpha 14 caravan in the wet to an average speed of 124.91&nbsp;mph, having seen 152&nbsp;mph on the speedometer exiting the timed quarter mile. The speed beat the previous record of 108&nbsp;mph.

=== 1981 ===
[[Image:1977AstonMartinAMV8.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Aston Martin RHAM/1 at Goodwood Festival of Speed 2009]]
With his first hand experience at [[Le Mans]], [[Robin Hamilton (racing driver)|Robin Hamilton]] went on to develop the [[Nimrod Racing Automobiles|Aston Martin Nimrod]] [[Group C]] racing car in the early 1980s.

=== 1984 ===

RHAM/1 was put up for sale by [[Robin Hamilton (racing driver)|Robin Hamilton]] in 1984 when he closed his business and was bought by Chris Crawford.

=== 2005 ===

In 2005 RHAM/1 was for sale with Nicholas Mee's [[Aston Martin]] Car Company.

=== 2006 ===

RHAM/1 was on sale at [[Bonhams|Bonhams']] [[Aston Martin]] auction held on 13 May 2006 at Works Service, Newport Pagnell

== DBSV8/10071/R ==

[[Robin Hamilton (racing driver)|Robin Hamilton]] built a second [[Le Mans]] styled [[Aston Martin V8|DBS V8]] car based on the look of RHAM/1 as it was in 1978. The car was assembled for Peter Griggs who wanted a replica of the car. The car, with chassis number DBSV8/10071/R featured a fibre glass front end and Piper prepared V8 engine, but the car had no [[turbocharger]]. Fuel injection was replaced by 48 IDA down-draught [[Weber carburetor|Weber carburettors]].

The car had some success with Griggs, winning a race at the 1981 [[Aston Martin Owners Club|AMOC]] [[Brands Hatch]] meeting, even though the car was quite heavy. In 1982 the car finished 2nd at Brands Hatch and 4th at an Intermarque race at [[Silverstone Circuit|Silverstone]].

Richard Williams bought the car in 1987 with intentions of upgrading the car with an experimental 6.3 litre V8 engine and racing it in the Intermarque events. However the disassembled car was sold to Marsh Plant Holdings where it was reassembled.

The '''Daihatsu Tanto Exe''' is a [[Kei car]] produced by [[Daihatsu]]. The production version made its debut at the 2009 [[Tokyo Motor Show]] and was launched on December 24, 2009 by Daihatsu and April 20, 2010 by Subaru as the '''Subaru Lucra'''. The Tanto Exe was designed to compete with models such as the [[Honda Life]], [[Nissan Moco]] and [[Suzuki Wagon R]]. The Daihatsu Tanto Exe Custom, a more sports-oriented version of the Tanto Exe with sports styling, was launched simultaneously. The Daihatsu Tanto Exe and Tanto Exe Custom are both available with a 659cc petrol engine, mated to a 4-speed automatic gearbox on front wheel drive models and [[Continuously variable transmission|CVT]] on four wheel drive models.

==Subaru Lucra==
[[File:Subaru Lucra.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Subaru Lucra]]
Due to Subaru's strengthened alliance with [[Daihatsu]] and [[Toyota]] (announced April 16, 2008), the company has been able to launch the Lucra to market. Essentially, the Subaru Lucra is a rebadged Daihatsu Tanto Exe, and the Subaru Lucra Custom is a rebadged Daihatsu Tanto Exe Custom.

The Daihatsu Tanto Exe and Daihatsu Tanto Exe Custom were discontinued on October 2, 2014, due to declining sales caused by the launch of the third-generation Daihatsu Tanto and third-generation Daihatsu Tanto Custom the previous year. The discontinuation left the Subaru Lucra and Subaru Lucra Custom as original Subaru models, even though they were still both being manufactured by Daihatsu. The Subaru Lucra and Subaru Lucra Custom, however, lasted until April 1, 2015, when they were discontinued due to changing tax consumption rules.

The '''Aston Martin DPLM''' (formally known as the '''Gipfast Special''') is a [[sports prototype]] racing car that was built by David Preece and Ken Heywood.  Utilizing an [[Aston Martin]] [[V8 engine]] tuned by AVJ Developments, the car was designed to participate in the [[World Sportscar Championship]] as well as the [[1980 24 Hours of Le Mans]].<ref name="1980 24 Hours of Le Mans entry list">{{cite web|url=http://www.racingsportscars.com/covers/_Le_Mans-1980-06-15e.jpg|title=1980 24 Hours of Le Mans entry list|publisher=Racing Sports Cars}}</ref>  The original Gipfast Special was damaged in its debut race in 1980, while a second chassis was constructed for use in 1982.  Despite the team's intentions, the DPLM only participated in two major races.

After partnering with Robin Hamilton in the [[1977 24 Hours of Le Mans]] in the unique [[Aston Martin RHAM/1]], Shropshire dentist David Preece set out to create his own car which could compete at Le Mans. During 1979 and 1980 Preece was joined by skilled engineer Ken Heywood to design and build the car which would eventually become known as the Gipfast Special. Other than the engine, most of the project was built in Preece's own garage.  The Gipfast was powered by a mid mounted Aston Martin V8 engine based on the production engine utilized in the [[Aston Martin V8]], similar to that used on the RHAM/1. The engine was tuned by AVJ Developments of Pershore, featuring dry sump lubrication and Cosworth DFV style fuel injection, producing around 480&nbsp;bhp.  The initial chassis, DP/801/H, was completed in early 1980 and entered in the World Championship [[1980 Silverstone 6 Hours|6 Hours  of Silverstone]] in May of that year.  Partnered alongside the returning RHAM/1 under the control of Simon Phillips Racing, the two Aston Martins ran under the title of sponsor Ault & Wiborg.  The Gipfast struggled for speed in its debut, qualifying 29th out of 30 entries and was slower than the RHAM/1.  At the start of the six hour endurance race, the DPLM suffered a suspension failure after only four laps and crashed heavily.  The damage to the car was unable to be repaired in time for Le Mans a month later and the car was abandoned later that year.

===DP/812/H===
After the demise of DP/801/H, Preece and Heywood spent 1981-82 developing a new car, now known as the DPLM (Dave Preece Le Mans).  The second chassis, DP/812/H, was front engined and retained the same AVJ built V8 engine now rumoured to be producing 560&nbsp;bhp.  Debuting in Britain once again at the [[World Sports Car Championship]] 1000 Kilometers at [[Brands Hatch]], the car qualified 28th out of 33 entrants.  The race performance was stunted as the DPLM crashed in the opening laps in treturous weather conditions.  Following the second failure for the DPLM project, the car was retired from competitive use and made successful appearances in [[Aston Martin Owners Club]] and other national events during the rest of the 1980s driven by Preece and later Barrie 'Whizzo' Williams, for the then owner Stewart Bond. The car was purchased from Bond around the year 2000 and was sympathetically restored and recommissioned by its current owners of the Hipwell family, appearing at the AMOC Horsfall meeting at Silverstone in 2003 where the car suffered from fuel feed problems and DNS.

'''Rennzweier''' (The Double Racer) is a veteran automobile manufactured by [[Tatra (car)|Nesselsdorfer Wagenbau-Fabriks-Gesellschaft A.G.]] (now known as Tatra) in 1900. It is sometimes called also as ''First racing'', ''12 HP'' or ''Rennwagen'' (The Race Car). It was manufactured on order of baron Theodor von Liebig. Also [[Hans Ledwinka]], at the time only 20 years old, was taking part in construction of the car, later to become the most important Tatra designer. The car was manufactured on May 5, 1900, and the manufacture process took only 5 weeks.

==Predecessor racers==
[[File:NW Rennzweier Front.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Front view]]
[[File:NW Rennzweier Side.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Side view]]
In 1899, the NW-cars Wien and Nesselsdorf (descendant models after the [[Präsident]]), achieved their first significant racing success on the trotter course in Vienna Prater. It was the first race in Austrian monarchy at all - started on October 23, 1899. The driver of the winning NW-car ''Wien'' was baron Theodor von Liebig. The other NW-car ''Nesselsdorf'' was the second one before all concurrent of four Benz-cars and four Dietrich-Bolleé cars. Later in March 1900 Liebig raced the triangle 192&nbsp;km track Nizza - Draguignan - Nizza, where he won the second stage at all. Four days later he won the class of four-seaters up to 1000&nbsp;kg in famous hill climb race Nizza - La Turbié. Based on this achievements, baron Liebig ordered a construction of a new automobile. While the previous cars Liebig used in races were built as common cars, the one he ordered was to be designed purposely as a race car.<ref name="ReferenceRosenkranz">Tatra - Passenger Cars, Karel Rosenkranz, TATRA, a. s., 2007</ref>

==Design==
The construction was unique at the time. The car was very low, especially the drivers seat. There was no carrossery - all mechanical parts were uncovered. Unlike its predecessors, the steering column was slightly tilted.

The car had modified Benz engine. It was two cylinders spark ignition engine with power output of about 9&nbsp;kW (12HP) at 1800RPM. It was situated above the driven rear axle, long-wise with the cars axis.

The driver was situated on heightened seat behind the steering wheel, while the passenger's seat was much lower on the frame, so his legs were sticking out under the car.

The gas tank had volume of 42 liters, while there was also another tank behind the driver for 15 liters of coolant.

The car was able to reach maximum speed of 82&nbsp;km/h.

Von Liebig raced the car in numerous contests. He won the race Nice - La Turbie, and took second position in [[Salzburg]]-[[Linz]]-[[Vienna]] race. He later took part also in [[Paris]]-Vienna race.

Today the Rennzweier is in the [[National Technical Museum (Prague)|Czech National Technical Museum]].

Second racing car was made in 1901. It was again without carrossery, and this time a ''Hardy'' engine (flat two, 3188cc, 7,4&nbsp;kW-8,85&nbsp;kW (10-12HP)) was used instead of the previous Benz one.<ref name="ReferenceRosenkranz"/>

The '''Penske PC-22''' was a [[Champ Car|CART]] [[Penske Racing]] car which competed in the [[1993 IndyCar season|1993 season]]. It raced in all sixteen events, scoring eight wins, three with [[Emerson Fittipaldi]] and five with [[Paul Tracy]]. The most remarkable success of the PC-22 was the [[1993 Indianapolis 500]] win by Fittipaldi, placed 2nd at the end of the season, missing the championship by only 8 points. The car was designed by [[Nigel Bennett (car designer)|Nigel Bennett]] as a radical departure from the basic concept of the previous [[Penske Racing|Penske]] cars.<ref name="PC222"/>

The PC-22 debuted at [[1993 Australian FAI IndyCar Grand Prix]], noted for the sensational debut win of [[Nigel Mansell]], qualifying 2nd with Fittipaldi and 3rd with Tracy. In the race, Fittipaldi scored a 2nd place finish, while Tracy retired for electrical problems. At [[XM Satellite Radio Indy 200|Phoenix]], the first oval race of the season, both Penskes went off, while in [[Grand Prix of Long Beach|Long Beach]] Tracy scored the first win for the PC-22. In [[1993 Indianapolis 500|Indianapolis]], Fittipaldi qualified 9th (220.150&nbsp;mph),<ref name="PC223">{{cite web

Foyt 225|Milwaukee]] and [[Detroit Indy Grand Prix|Detroit]], with only one podium finish, the Penske come back to victory in [[Grand Prix of Portland|Portland]], with Fittipaldi 1st and Tracy 3rd. Two 1-2 wins followed, in [[Grand Prix of Cleveland|Cleveland]] and [[Honda Indy Toronto|Toronto]], with Tracy 1st and Fittipaldi 2nd in both occasions. Nigel Mansell scored two wins at [[Firestone Indy 400|Michigan]] and [[New Hampshire Motor Speedway|New Hampshire]] as a major push for his championship bid, while Fittipaldi and Tracy at New Hampshire scored a 2nd and 3rd place respectively. Tracy won at [[Champ Car Grand Prix of Road America|Road America]]

==Overview==
The PC-23 was a design evolution of its predecessor, the [[Penske PC-22|PC-22]],<ref name="PC232"/> which won the [[1993 Indianapolis 500]], 8 races over the entire season, and missing the [[1993 IndyCar season|1993 CART]] title by only 8 points.<ref name="PC234">{{cite web

}}</ref> The only substantial difference of the new car from it were the smaller rear wings on the [[Oval track racing|short ovals]], mandatory by rule changes for the 1994 season, and Team Penske put in a lot of test efforts to minimize the effects of these changes. There were also some modifications on the transmission, but the new car was mostly an progression. Plans to fit the PC-23 with an [[active suspension]] system were canceled due to a ban by CART on such technology.<ref name="PC232"/> The car and the Ilmor engine were ready for testing by mid December 1993.

The Indy 500 version of the PC-23, showed a much higher engine cover, required because of the new engine. Other modifications included changes to the input gears of the [[gearbox]], to cope with the lower rpm and higher power and [[torque]] the pushrod engine provided. However, the two versions of the gearbox were of the same weight, thus causing no shift in the weight balance. The Mercedes-Benz 500I engine was slightly lighter than the Ilmor Indy V8, although because of its longer inlets the center of gravity of the entire engine was higher than that of the 500I, thus changing the overall balance of the car a bit.<ref name="PC232"/> The development and testing of the 500I engine, at that time called Ilmor 265E, took place in the utmost secrecy, because there was a possibility of the turbocharger boost level being changed, or the engine being banned by the Indy 500 sanctioning body.<ref name="PC232"/>

| accessdate=}}</ref> the three-car Penske team ([[Al Unser, Jr.|Unser]], [[Emerson Fittipaldi]] and [[Paul Tracy]]) dominated most of the month, and nearly the entire race. This engine used a provision in the rules intended for stock block [[Cam-in-block|pushrod]] engines such as the [[V6 engine|V-6]] [[Buick]] engines that allowed an extra 650&nbsp;cm³ and 10&nbsp;[[Inch of mercury|inches]] (4.9&nbsp;[[Pound-force per square inch|psi]]/33.8&nbsp;[[Pascal (unit)|kPa]]) of boost. This extra power (at least 900 [[horsepower]], and rumored to be in excess of 1000 [[Horsepower|hp]], which was up a 150-200&nbsp;hp advantage over the conventional V-8s.<ref name="NYT 5-22"/>) allowed the Penskes to run significantly faster, giving them the pole and outside front row on the grid for the [[1994 Indianapolis 500|78th Indianapolis 500]]. [[Al Unser, Jr.]] and [[Emerson Fittipaldi]] dominated the race, eventually lapping the field with 16 laps to go in the 200 lap race when Emerson made contact with wall coming out of Turn 4, giving [[Al Unser, Jr.]] the lead and win. The only other driver who finished on the lead lap was rookie [[Jacques Villeneuve]].

In the summer and fall of 1993,<ref name="NYT 5-22"/> Ilmor and Penske engaged in a new engine program. Under complete secrecy,<ref name="NYT 5-22"/> a 209-cid purpose-built, pushrod engine was being developed.<ref name="NYT 4-18"/> [[Mercedes-Benz in motorsport|Mercedes]] took over the project, and dubbed the engine the ''Mercedes-Benz 500I''. The engine was designed to exploit a perceived "[[loophole]]" that existed in [[United States Auto Club|USAC]]'s rulebook since 1991.<ref name="NYT 5-22"/> While CART sanctioned the rest of the Indycar season, the Indianapolis 500 itself was conducted by USAC under slightly different rules.

In an effort to appeal to smaller engine-building companies, USAC had permitted "stock-block" pushrod engines (generally defined as single [[Overhead valve|non-OHC]] units fitted with two [[Poppet valve|valves]] per cylinder actuated by [[pushrod]] and [[rocker arm]]). The traditional "stock blocks," saw some limited use in the early 1980s, but became mainstream at Indy starting with the introduction of the [[Buick]] V-6 Indy engine. Initially, the stock blocks were required to have some production-based parts. However in 1991, USAC quietly lifted the requirement, and purpose-built pushrod engines were permitted to be designed for racing at the onset. Attempting to create an equivalency formula,<ref name="NYT 5-22"/> both pushrod engine formats were allowed increased [[Engine displacement|displacement]] (209.3&nbsp;[[Cubic inch|cid]] vs. 161.7),<ref name="NYT 4-18"/> and increased [[turbocharger]] boost (55&nbsp;[[Inch of mercury|inHG]] vs. 45&nbsp;inHG)<ref name="NYT 4-18"/>

Team Penske mated the engine with the in-house Penske chassis, the PC-23. It was introduced to the public in April, just days before opening day at Indy.

==Legacy==
The car in its Indy 500 version caused a considerable uproar at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway and in the [[Auto racing|racing world]] in general. Subsequently, the PC-23 was recognized as one of the triggers of the [[Champ Car|CART]]/[[Indy Racing League|IRL]] split,<ref name="PC231">{{cite web

The PC-23 influenced subsequent rule making at Indianapolis.

The first experimental vehicles were built in the 17th and 18th century, but it was not until after [[Richard Trevithick]] had developed the use of high-pressure steam, around 1800, that mobile steam engines became a practical proposition. The first half of the 19th century saw great progress in steam vehicle design, and by the 1850s it was viable to produce them on a commercial basis. The next sixty years saw continuing improvements in vehicle technology and manufacturing techniques and steam road vehicles were used for many applications. In the 20th century, the rapid development of [[internal combustion engine]] technology led to the demise of the steam engine as a source of propulsion of vehicles on a commercial basis prior to the [[Second World War]]. Since then there has been sporadic resurgences of interest in steam, particularly in the late 1960s in [[California]] to address air pollution issues and later in response to the [[1973 oil crisis]].

The manufacturers listed here were those active during the first period of [[steam car]] production, roughly 1860–1930, but mostly around 1900. From 1940 on steam cars listed here have tended to be either prototypes or experimental.

In 1991, it raced in all seventeen events, scoring 3 wins, two with [[Rick Mears]], and one with [[Emerson Fittipaldi]], placed 4th and 5th at the season's end respectively. The most remarkable success of the PC-20 was the [[1991 Indianapolis 500]] win by Mears, his 4th win at the Brickyard. The car was designed by [[Nigel Bennett (car designer)|Nigel Bennett]], his 4th for Penske Racing.<ref name="PC201">{{cite web

==Racing history==
The PC-20 was powered by an [[Ilmor]]-[[Chevrolet]] V8 265A turbo engine and it debuted at the [[1991 Gold Coast IndyCar Grand Prix]] where it qualified 6th and 7th with Fittipaldi and Mears, respectively. In the race Mears scored a 3rd place, while Fittipaldi retired with drive shaft failure. After a 4th place finish in [[Grand Prix of Long Beach|Long Beach]] with Mears, and a 3rd place finish at [[XM Satellite Radio Indy 200|Phoenix]] with Fittipaldi, the PC-20 scored its biggest win at [[1991 Indianapolis 500]]. In qualifying, Mears clinched his 6th pole at Indy 500 (224.113&nbsp;mph<ref name="PC202">{{cite web
|publisher=www.race-database.com
|url=http://www.race-database.com/driver/career.php?driver_id=rmear1
|title=Rick Mears
}}</ref>). Mears battled with [[Michael Andretti]] during final stages of the race, who led Rick Mears by 15 seconds when a caution flag flies on lap 182. Andretti was able to make it to the pits for fuel under the yellow, while Mears lined up as the leader. Andretti then completed a daring pass around the outside of Mears into turn 1 on the restart. Exactly one lap later, Mears repeated the move on Andretti, passing him on the outside of turn one to re-take the lead. Another caution does not alter the result as Mears powered away again to his record-tying fourth Indianapolis 500 Victory,<ref name="PC204">{{cite web

In [[1992 IndyCar season|1992]], the PC-20 chassis was used by Penske Racing, as a third car for [[Paul Tracy]] in early stages of season (Tracy was driving the #4 car in second half of the season as replacement for injured Mears), and for entire season by [[Bettenhausen Racing]], with [[Tony Bettenhausen, Jr.]] and [[Stefan Johansson]] sharing the #16 car, with two 3rd places by Johansson as best results. It [[Team Penske#Complete CART FedEx Championship Series results|raced]] along the PC-21.

The PC-21 was instead powered by an [[Ilmor]]-[[Chevrolet]] 265B V8 turbo engine. It made its race debut in the Gold Coast, Australia, at the renamed [[1992 Daikyo IndyCar Grand Prix|Daikyo IndyCar Grand Prix]] where it finished first and second, driven by Fittipaldi and Mears, respectively. It is also the last car that Mears drove to his final career podium finish.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.johncummiskeyracing.com/?page_id=59|title=1992 Penske PC21-005|publisher=John Cummiskey Racing|accessdate=12 November 2014}}</ref>

===Ayrton Senna tests===
In December 1992, concerned by possibly being unable to secure a competitive drive for the {{f1|1993}} [[Formula One]] season, three-time world champion [[Ayrton Senna]] test-drove a PC-21<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ayrtonsenna.com.br/en/historias/dentro-das-pistas/provas-especiais/o-teste-com-a-penske-na-formula-indy|title=Penske test in Indy|publisher=Ayrton Senna Official|accessdate=9 November 2014}}</ref> at [[Firebird International Raceway]] in [[Chandler, Arizona]]. This test was facilitated by the fact that Penske Racing's lead driver was countryman Fittipaldi, and they were both sponsored by [[Marlboro (cigarette)#Other racing series|Marlboro]]. According to former Penske race engineer Nigel Beresford, Senna completed 24 laps in the car after which "He came back into the pits and said: 'Thank you very much, I've learned what I need to know.' Then he got out of the car and that was that." Senna covered the initial 14 laps relatively slowly to familiarize himself with the PC-21 since, unlike F1 racers of the time, [[Champ Car|IndyCars]] were markedly heavier and powered by a turbocharged engine. More crucially, they had a traditional transmission with clutch pedal and iron brakes, unlike the semi-automatic transmissions and carbon brakes used in F1. In his subsequent 10 laps using the same tyres, Senna set a best time was 49.09 seconds, which compared favourably with Fittipaldi's time of 49.70 seconds. The latter subsequently improved his time achieving 48.5 seconds, only after driving the new 1993 [[Penske PC-22]], which was also at his disposal during this test session.<ref>Fagnan, René (2012-08-27).

'''Arma''' is 6x6 and 8x8 amphibious wheeled [[armoured combat vehicle]]<ref>https://www.otokar.com.tr/tr/urunler/urun_detay.aspx?urun=102</ref><ref>https://www.otokar.com.tr/tr/urunler/urun_detay.aspx?urun=104</ref> family designed and developed by [[Otokar]]. The vehicle is a modular multi-wheel configurable with high level of ballistic and mine protection due to its high hardness monocoque steel hull.<ref>http://www.otokar.com.tr/en/media_relations/p_haber_detay.aspx?haber=236</ref>

==Development==
Otokar developed the vehicle to target the Turkish Land Forces’ Special Purpose Tactical Wheeled Armoured Vehicle (''Özel Maksatlı Taktik Tekerlekli Zırhlı Araç, ÖMTTZA'') project. It is competing against two other vehicles in the shape of FNSS Defence Systems’ Pars and HEMA Endustri’s Anafarta, a variant of Patria’s 6×6 Armoured Modular Vehicle (AMV). Turkish Land Forces are expected to make a selection for its OMTTZA requirement by mid-2010 and subsequently procure 336 vehicles in a variety of versions: 30 for NBC reconnaissance, 36 radar carriers, 108 sensor carriers, 39 command vehicles and 108 fire-support vehicles, which could be armed with a manually operated 20&nbsp;mm cannon. Mobility tests with prototypes to date have included around 10,000&nbsp;km of running over varied terrain.<ref name=armytech>{{cite web|title=Arma 6x6|url=http://www.army-technology.com/projects/arma6x6/|work=Army-Technology|accessdate=9 May 2014}}</ref>

Otokar presented the first time to the public the Arma wheeled armoured vehicle at Eurosatory 2010. The ARMA is the latest product of Otokar’s design and development studies and a proof of Otokar’s ability to leverage its engineering, manufacturing and expertise across a large portfolio of armoured tactical vehicles. ARMA is a new product family within the Otokar’s the tactical wheeled armoured vehicle range with modular multi-wheel configuration. ARMA vehicle platform with superior tactical and technical features will be an outstanding and cost effective product among competitive products. Thanks to the high level of ballistic and mine protection as well as, the outstanding design allowing the integration of various types of weapon stations and mission equipment, ARMA will be an adaptable platform for evolving mission needs in a modern battlefield. ARMA vehicle’s development started in 2007 as a company funded development project for home and export markets. <ref name=armytech/>

Development studies from concept design till the end of test phases including qualification and validation processes, detailed design, computer aided engineering studies, are performed by Otokar. ARMA 6x6 is ready for full scale production and the family will be complemented by an 8x8 version late in 2010. In 2010, Turkish leading land systems manufacturer, Otokar received the first contract for its new 6x6 tactical armoured vehicle ARMA from abroad. The contract is valued in excess of $10.6 million including the vehicles, spare parts and training. Deliveries under this contract award are expected to be completed in 15 months. In June 2011, Otokar has been awarded a $63.2 million second contract for its new 6x6 tactical armoured vehicle ARMA.<ref name=armytech/>

===Foreign interest===
At [[International Defence Industry Fair|IDEF-2013]], the [[Azerbaijan Army]] expressed interest in the Arma 8x8 vehicle.<ref>[http://www.armyrecognition.com/may_2013_news_defence_army_military_industry_uk/azerbaijan_shows_interest_for_turkish_main_battle_tank_altay_and_8x8_armoured_vehicle_arma_1705134.html Azerbaijan shows interest for Turkish armored vehicles] - Armyrecognition.com, May 17, 2013</ref>

==Design==

===Armament===
The first prototype of the Arma is equipped with a circle ring support, armed with a single 12.7&nbsp;mm heavy machine gun. A [[tank destroyer]] variant sporting a 105mm cannon has also been exhibited.<ref>[http://www.otokar.com.tr/en/media_relations/p_haber_detay.aspx?haber=375 Otokar, Land Defence Systems House of Turkey, Unveils TULPAR Armoured Tracked Vehicle at IDEF]</ref> The Arma could probably be equipped a large range of manned and remote weapons stations.

===Protection===
No details have been released on its ballistic protection, but since it is required to be amphibious, armouring is not expected to exceed STANAG 4569 Level II, but its relatively high 425&nbsp;mm ground clearance should help achieve mine protection to Level IIIB or higher. ARMA’s ballistic and anti-mine protection is provided by high hardness monocoque steel hull and all personnel is seated on anti- mine seats.<ref name=armytech/>

===Propulsion===
The Arma 6x6 is motorised with a 450&nbsp;hp water-cooled turbo diesel capable of running on F-34 or F-54 fuel drives the wheels through an automatic gearbox and single-speed transfer box, giving it a top speed of 105&nbsp;km/h and a power/weight ratio of 24.3&nbsp;hp/tonne. This also powers the onboard 24 V DC electrical system, which incorporates two maintenance-free 125 Ah batteries and a 3.3&nbsp;kW converter. Arma’s front two axles are steerable enabling it to make a turning radius of 7.85 m and the vehicle rides on independent hydropneumatic suspension, offering respectable off-road mobility and comfort. It can negotiate 45-degree [[approach and departure angles]] leading onto 60 per cent inclines and 30 per cent side-slopes. It can also cross 1.2&nbsp;m-wide trenches and climb over 60&nbsp;cm obstacles.<ref name=armytech/>

===Accessories===
The ARMA can be transported by a C-130 plane. Standard equipment of ARMA 6x6 includes NBC protection system and air conditioning. ARMA can be driven in 6x6 or 6x4 modes depending upon the terrain conditions. The vehicle is amphibious and driven by 2 hyraulically driven propellors in water allowing a high seagoing performance with a pivot turn capability.<ref name=armytech/>

The main strategies to alleviate range anxiety among electric car drivers are the deployment of extensive [[charging infrastructure]], the development of higher battery capacity at a cost-effective price, [[battery swapping]] technology, use of [[range extender]]s, accurate navigation and range prediction and availability of free loaners for long trips.

==Battery swapping==
[[Battery swapping]] is a strategy to avoid range anxiety that allows electric cars to extend their range through a battery switch station. At the station, the depleted battery is swapped for fully charged battery in about the same time that it takes to fill up a car with gasoline.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.betterplace.com/the-solution-switch-stations |author=[[Better Place]]|publisher=Better Place|accessdate=2014-04-21|title=How we give the electric car unlimited range}}</ref> Battery swapping is common in warehouses using electric [[forklift truck]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://us.simplenewz.com/industrial-electrical-vehicle-stalwarts-head-out-on-the-road--2009-03-08--ars-technica--30.672.7|title=Industrial electrical vehicle stalwarts head out on the road|date=2009-03-09|author=Ars Technica|publisher=simpleNews|accessdate=2013-04-21}}</ref>

As the electric car emerged as the main competing technology in the late 1890s until the 1920s, the concept of exchangeable battery service was first proposed as early as 1896 in order to overcome the limited operating range of electric cars and trucks. The concept was first put into practice by [[Hartford Electric Light Company]] through the GeVeCo battery service and initially available for electric trucks. The vehicle owner purchased the vehicle from General Vehicle Company (GVC, a subsidiary of the General Electric Company) without a battery and the electricity was purchased from Hartford Electric through an exchangeable battery. The owner paid a variable per-mile charge and a monthly service fee to cover maintenance and storage of the truck. Both vehicles and batteries were modified to facilitate a fast battery exchange. The service was provided between 1910 to 1924 and during that period covered more than 6 million miles. Beginning in 1917 a similar successful service was operated in [[Chicago]] for owners of Milburn Light Electric cars who also could buy the vehicle without the batteries.<ref name=HistEV>{{cite book|last=Kirsch|first=David A.|title=The Electric Vehicle and the Burden of History|location=[[New Brunswick]], [[New Jersey]], and [[London]]| year = 2000| pages= 153–162| publisher =[[Rutgers University Press]]|isbn=0-8135-2809-7}}</ref>

Owners can pick up their battery pack fully charged on the return trip, which is included in the swap fee.

;Series plug-in hybrids

[[Plug-in hybrid]]s (PHEVs), as opposed to pure electric cars, eliminate the range anxiety concerns because the gasoline engine serves as a back-up to recharge the battery to provide electric power to the electric motor, or to provide propulsion directly. Access to a regular fuel station guarantees that a PHEV has similar driving ranges as conventional gasoline-powered automobile when required.<ref name=DiscoveyG>{{cite web|url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/range-anxiety-electric-cars1.htm|title=Could Range Anxiety Sabotage the Promise of Electric Cars?|publisher=Discovery's Planet Green|author= Michael Graham Richard|date=2009-10-14|accessdate=2010-03-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ceage.vt.edu/phev|title=Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV)|publisher=Center for Energy and the Global Environment, [[Virginia Tech]]|accessdate=2010-12-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hybridcars.com/plug-in-hybrid-cars|title=What Is A Plug-in Hybrid Car?|publisher=HybridCars.com|accessdate=2010-12-29}}</ref>

In April 2013, Fiat North America announced a program to allow customers to cover longer travel distances, as each [[Fiat 500e]] purchase includes the use of rental vehicles for up to 12 days a year for free through the first three years of ownership. The program, called ePass, entitles 500e owners to a business account with enough points to rent a gasoline-powered standard car with [[Enterprise Holdings]], which owns [[Enterprise Rent-A-Car]], [[National Car Rental]] and [[Alamo Rent a Car]]. Fiat deposits additional points the following two years to extend the program.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.autonews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20130401/RETAIL07/304019968/buy-a-fiat-500e-use-alternate-cars-for-free#axzz2PDMDQzlJ |title=Buy a Fiat 500e, use alternate cars for free|author=Larry P.

The '''T.25''' or Type 25 is a [[city car]] designed by [[Gordon Murray]], who created the [[McLaren F1]] supercar. The car made its first public appearance on June 28, 2010 at the UK's Smith School of Enterprise and the Environment in Oxford.<ref name="T25CNNRef">{{cite web|first= Matthew|last=Knight|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Former F1 engineer unveils new city car|work=|publisher=[[CNN]]|date=2010-06-29|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2010/TECH/innovation/06/28/murray.green.car.launch/index.html?iref=mpstoryview&fbid=fhr0Cv7hUA6|format=|doi=|accessdate=2010-06-29}}</ref>

==Description==
At 2.4&nbsp;m (7'&nbsp;10½") long, 1.3&nbsp;m (4'&nbsp;3") wide and 1.6&nbsp;m (5'&nbsp;3") high; the T.25 is smaller than [[Daimler AG]]'s popular [[Smart (automobile)|Smart]].<ref>{{Cite web| last=Madslien|first=Jorn|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=F1 designer Gordon Murray unveils lightweight city car|work=|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=2010-09-19|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-11301831|format=|doi=|accessdate=2010-09-19}}</ref> The centralized driving position is also a feature of Murray's iconic McLaren F1; central instrumentation and controls are borrowed from Formula One. It is a Three Seater Car with a rear mounted three-cylinder petrol engine.<ref name="T25CNNRef"/> From the details released by its designer Murray, three T.25s can be parked in one standard UK parallel parking space, thereby increasing much needed urban parking capacity; in addition, its compact size will allow two T.25s to travel side-by-side (theoretically) in one UK motorway lane.<ref>[http://www.gordonmurraydesign.com/t25.php "T.25 - The Facts - Gordon Murray Design"]</ref>

The '''Citroën DS4''' is the second model in the new premium ([[luxury vehicle]]) [[DS car marque|DS]] sub-brand created by [[Citroën]] to run alongside its mainstream cars. It was officially launched in 2011 internationally, but already on sale in some countries in late 2010.<ref name="PSA Annual Report 2012"/> Based upon the [[Citroën C4]] II, it features raised suspension to resemble a compact SUV and repositioned door handles to give a coupe-like silhouette. The rear windows are fixed, and do not slide or open outwards<ref>{{cite web|author=Post your review! |url=http://www.carwow.co.uk/car-reviews/Citroen/DS4 |title=Citroen DS4 reviews &#124; Expert and user reviews |publisher=carwow.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-02-03}}</ref>

The petrol engines that power the DS4 are a product of a collaboration between PSA and BMW.  All are 1,598 cc four-cylinder, 16-valve units. The base VTi 120 is normally aspirated and puts out {{Convert|120|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}}.  As its name implies it comes with variable valve timing.  The next engine up is the THP 155, essentially a turbo-charged version of the VTi.  It puts out {{Convert|156|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} thanks to a twin-scroll turbocharger and dual overhead cams.  It is mated to a 6-speed manual transmission.  The most powerful gas engine available in the DS4 is the THP 200.  It's a variation of the THP 155 previously mentioned but pushed to {{Convert|200|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}}.

Citroen offers two diesel engines in the DS4 - the HDi 110, a 1,560 cc four-cylinder that puts out {{Convert|112|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}}.  The second is the four-cylinder HDi 160 also found in the Citroën C5 sedan.  It has a displacement of 1,997 cc and puts out {{Convert|163|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}}.

The DS4 is available with [[Start&Stop]] technology and Citroën says that the battery has been optimized to withstand up to 600,000 starting cycles. The trunk are 385 L and 1021 L with the back seat folded down on all models.

The DS4's styling has been very well received by the international press.

It was elected ''Most Beautiful Car of the Year'' at the International Automobile Festival,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.citroen.co.nz/news/general-news/citroen-ds4-voted-most-beautiful-car | title=Citroën DS4 Voted Most Beautiful Car of the Year | publisher=Citroën | accessdate=March 21, 2013}}</ref> beating [[BMW]]’s new [[BMW 5 Series (F10)|F10 5 Series]] and [[Honda]]'s new [[Honda CR-Z|CR-Z]] [[hybrid car]]. German magazine [[Auto Bild]] and its partner magazines throughout Europe have given it 1st Prize for Design in its category in Design Award contest.<ref>{{cite web|title=Citroën DS4 gets first prize in Auto Bild’s design award contest.|url=http://europeancarnews.com/2011/05/24/citroen-ds4-gets-first-prize-in-auto-bilds-design-award-contest/}}</ref>

The [[Euro NCAP|European New Car Assessment Programme]] (Euro NCAP) (Europe’s rough equivalent to the U.S.’s IIHS) gave the DS4 a five-star rating overall.

===Giulia Quadrifoglio===
The high-performance Giulia Quadrifoglio ("Cloverleaf") was the first model in the new Giulia range to be revealed, in June 2015. It is powered by an all-[[aluminium]], [[twin-turbocharged]] 90° V6 petrol engine, with a single cylinder displacement of just under half a litre,<ref name="QR 08/15" /> for a total of 2.9–3.0&nbsp;L. This engine was developed exclusively for the Quadrifoglio by Ferrari technicians<ref name="alfaromeopress" /> and it is related to Ferrari's own twin-turbo [[Ferrari F154 engine|F154 V8]].<ref name="QR 08/15" /> It produces {{convert|510|PS|kW bhp|0}},<ref name="autocar 24/06/15" /> and around {{convert|600|Nm|lbft|-1|abbr=on}} of torque.<ref name="QR 08/15" /> The V6 features [[Variable displacement|cylinder deactivation]], being able of switching off three of its six cylinders.<ref name="QR 08/15" />

According to the manufacturer, the Giulia Quadrifoglio can accelerate from a standstill to {{convert|100|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}} in 3.9&nbsp;seconds<ref name="alfaromeopress">{{cite web |url=http://www.alfaromeopress.com/press/article/117019 |title=World preview of the Alfa Romeo Giulia |website=alfaromeopress.com |type=press release |publisher=[[Fiat Chrysler Automobiles]] |date=24 June 2015 |accessdate=24 June 2015}}</ref><ref name="C&D 24/06/15" /> The car's power to weight ratio is 3&nbsp;kg/PS,<ref name="24ore">{{cite web |url=http://www.motori24.ilsole24ore.com/Auto-Novita/2015/06/Alfa-Romeo-nuova-giulia-quadrifoglio.php |first=Mario| last=Cianflone |title=Alfa Romeo è tornata: ecco la nuova Giulia da 510 cavalli |trans-title=Alfa Romeo is back: here is the new 510 horsepower Giulia |website=[[Il Sole 24 Ore]] |date=24 June 2015 |language=it |accessdate=6 August 2015}}</ref> also thanks to the fact that, in addition to the other models' composite and light alloy parts, the Quadrifoglio has a carbon fibre roof and [[Hood (vehicle)|engine bonnet]].<ref name="topgear" />

[[File:" 15 - ITALY - Alfa Romeo Giulia QV (pre series) at Museo Alfa Romeo Arese world premiere 05.jpg|thumbnail|Rear view of the Giulia Quadrifoglio]]
From the front, the Quadrifoglio distinguishes itself from the rest of the range by a specific front bumper—with a carbon fibre splitter and enlarged air intakes for the twin [[intercooler]]s and for the brakes—and by a bonnet pierced by two cooling outlets for the engine bay. On the sides, the front [[Fender (vehicle)|wings]] also have outlets to extract air from the [[wheel well]]s, and bear [[Alfa Romeo#The Quadrifoglio|Quadrifoglio]] badges; the side skirts are specific to the model, as are the 19-inch<ref name="QR 08/15" /> alloy wheels. At the rear a low profile carbon fibre spoiler is applied to the boot lid, and a rear diffuser makes up the lower half of the bumper, flanked by quadruple exhaust tips. Working in conjunction with the faired-in underside, the [[Diffuser (automotive)|diffuser]] is fully functional in generating [[downforce]]—as at the front is the "Active Aero Splitter",<ref name="24ore" /> which can vary its [[angle of attack]] by 10º, moved by electric motors.<ref name="QR 08/15" /> Alfa Romeo claims both of these aerodynamic features to be firsts in the Giulia's market segment.<ref name="QR 08/15" />

Mechanically, this model is fitted with a [[torque vectoring]] rear [[Differential (mechanical device)|differential]],<ref name="C&D 24/06/15" /> able to send 100% of the torque to the left or right wheel,<ref name="carmagazine 10/07/15">{{cite web|url=http://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/alfa-romeo/seven-surprises-on-new-alfa-romeo-giulia-revealed-by-chief-engineer/ |first=Phil |last=McNamara |title=Seven surprises on new Alfa Romeo Giulia revealed by chief engineer |website=carmagazine.co.uk |date=10 July 2015 |accessdate=1 September 2015}}</ref> and, on the model which debuted in July 2015, a six-speed [[manual transmission]].<ref name="QR 08/15" /> The braking system uses [[Ceramic matrix composite|carbon ceramic]] rotors,<ref name="alfaromeopress" /> six-pot front and four-pot rear [[Brake caliper|calipers]], and auxiliary rear calipers for the [[parking brake]].

Inside, the dashboard is part-trimmed in leather and carbon fibre trim and the engine start button is located on the multi-function steering wheel. In addition, the driver is offered Alfa Romeo's "DNA" dynamic control selector, which is placed on the centre dashboard.<ref name="QR 08/15" /> Driving modes include the traditional "'''D'''ynamic", "'''N'''eutral" and "'''A'''dvanced" modes, plus new "Efficient" (for increased fuel economy) and "Racing" (for high performance).<ref name="24ore" />

The '''Suzuki Fronte 800''' was a 2-stroke [[subcompact]] car built by the Suzuki Motor Corporation in the latter half of the 1960s.

== History ==
Introduced in August 1965 (and on sale by December), the Fronte 800 was an attempt at competing in a higher market segment than the Suzulight [[Kei car|Kei jidosha]] class offerings. The name from its smaller engined brother, the [[Suzuki Fronte#Suzulight Fronte|Fronte]], was retained to aid the publicity effort. A four-door 700&nbsp;cc prototype was shown at the 1962 Tokyo Motor Show, clothed in a body designed by [[Pietro Frua]], reminiscent of his [[Maserati Quattroporte#Quattroporte I (1963–1969)|Maserati Quattroporte I]] and {{link-interwiki|vertical-align=sup | en = Glas 1700 | lang = de | lang_title = Glas 1700}} saloons.<ref name=CGweb>{{Cite web | author = Akira Tanuma | archiveurl=http://www.webcg.net/WEBCG/essays/korekiri/e0000018015.html | title=Hand Made People's Car #16: Suzuki Fronte 800 | date= 2003-05-03 | url=http://www.webcg.net/WEBCG/essays/korekiri/e0000018015.html | publisher=Car Graphic web | archivedate= 2010-07-28 }}</ref> This line of development was not followed, with work on the '''Y4''' prototype instead begun in 1962, another prototype appearing at the 1963 [[Tokyo Motor Show]]. Imminent production was announced, but at the '64 Motor Show another pre-production model was shown, with sales promised for the spring of the following year. Actual production, never but in a small scale and largely hand built, began in December 1965.<ref name=CGweb/>

=== Engine ===
The three-cylinder, two-stroke 785&nbsp;cc engine was very similar to that of the 796&nbsp;cc [[DKW Junior]]/F11, with a {{Convert|0.5|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} smaller bore and exactly the same stroke.<ref name=SuzukiStory>Ozeki, Kazuo. ''Suzuki Story: Small Cars, Big Ambitions''. Miki Press: 2007, p. 137-141. ISBN 978-4-89522-503-8</ref> Top speed was 115&nbsp;km/h,<ref>''Tutte le Auto del Mondo 1967'' claims a top speed of 120&nbsp;km/h.</ref> and the car was only available with a fully synchronized 4-speed column mounted manual transmission.<ref name=CarGraphic>''Car Graphic: Car Archives Vol. 1, '60s Japanese/American Cars''. Nigensha: 2000, p. 40. ISBN 978-4-544-09171-7</ref> Introductory price was ¥465,000, with a ¥545,000 DeLuxe version also available.

[[File:Suzuki-Fronte800rear.JPG|thumb|left|Rear view of Fronte 800]]
The body was a modern unibody design, only available as a two-door sedan. While rumoured to have been executed by [[Giovanni Michelotti|Michelotti]], design was credited to Suzuki chief designer Sasaki Toru (佐々木亨), who crafted a modern "soapbox" design with large glass surfaces. Suspension was an independent torsion bar design on all four wheels, with wishbones up front and trailing arms in rear.<ref name=CarGraphic/> Brakes were drums all around.<ref name=Ruiz>Ruiz, Marco. ''The Complete History of the Japanese Car: 1907 to the Present''. ERVIN srl., Rome: 1986, p.166. ISBN 0-517-61777-3</ref> Sales were slow, as the car competed directly with more popular cars like the [[Toyota Publica]] which were not handicapped by the Suzuki's by now outmoded two-stroke engine - while kei car buyers did not mind putting up with such a construction, car buyers in this segment were by now demanding more.<ref name="Meyer5">{{cite journal | journal = AutoPhyle | issue = Spring, #2 | year = 1996 | volume = 5 | last = Meyer | first = Allan G.

===History===
The 800 did not see a lot of updates during its production life: in April 1966 it gained separate front seats, as of June reclining such were available.<ref name=SuzukiStory/> A version with separate front seats received a floor mounted shifter.<ref>''Tutte le Auto del Mondo 1967''. '''Quattroruote Speciale''', Editoriale Domus, Milan: 1967, p. 282.</ref> By August 1966 the Standard version was cancelled, leaving only the DeLuxe. Production was cancelled in April 1969 after less than 3,000 were built in four years;<ref>{{cite book | editor = ＧＰ企画センター [GP Planning Center] | trans_title = History Timeline of the Japanese automobile | title = 日本自動車史年表 | publisher = GP Publications | location = Tokyo, Japan | year = 2006 | page = 101 | isbn = 978-4-87687-286-2}}</ref> slow sales, need for capacity to produce the hit [[Suzuki Fronte#Fronte 360|Fronte 360]], and a perceived inability to compete with the large domestic manufacturers in what had become the most closely contested Japanese market segment meant the end of the 800. By the time of the 1969 Tokyo Motor Show, the Fronte 800 had disappeared from Suzuki's pricelists, with 2717 built and 2612 sold.<ref name=SuzukiStory/> Suzuki was to focus exclusively on [[Kei car]]s (and bigger engined Kei iterations) until the 1983 introduction of the [[Suzuki Cultus|Cultus]].

The 1980s Suzuki Fronte hatchback was also marketed as the "Fronte 800" in some smaller markets such as Chile. Most countries outside of Japan received this particular car as the "Alto".

==Fronte 1100==
A 1.1 litre version, the '''C20''', was developed for a planned "Fronte 1100" model. The engine's design parallelled that of the {{convert|68|PS|kW|0|abbr=on|lk=on}} 1,175&nbsp;cc [[DKW F102]], but the triple [[Solex]]-carburetted {{convert|80|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} C20 was considerably more powerful. The front disc-brake equipped Fronte 1100's top speed was {{Convert|160|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}, but tiny Suzuki chose not to continue competing head on with the offerings of bigger manufacturers such as Toyota and Nissan.<ref name=SuzukiStory/> Additionally, with the market failure of the F102 the writing was on the wall for the two-stroke engine in cars any larger than the very smallest.

A distinguishing feature of the '''Nissan R88C''' was that it was powered by a new engine, the [[Nissan_VRH35_engine#Specification_of_VRH30T|VRH30]], developed for racing at Le Mans. The car too had evolved considerably, featuring a longer wheelbase to improve driving ease and [[Nissan]]’s original cowl design.

==Racing History==
Driven by #24 YHP’s No.1 driver, [[Masahiro Hasemi]], it took part in the 1988 and 1989 JSPC races (up to the 2nd round in 1989). In the 1988 season, it came in 3rd in the 1st round (Fuji) and 5th round (Suzuka). In 1989, it was 3rd in the 2nd round (Fuji) and 4th in the World Sports Prototype Championship (WSPC) 1st round (Suzuka).  It came in 15th overall in the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]] race in 1988.

The '''Büssing A5P''' was an [[Armored car (military)|armoured car]] produced in [[German Empire|Germany]] during [[World War I]].

==History==
The [[Büssing]] company had received its first orders of [[military vehicle]]s in 1910, producing [[artillery tractor]]s and supply trailers. By November 1914, the [[German Army (German Empire)|German Army]] had become aware of the potential of the armoured car by the hit-and-run tactics employed by the Belgians with the [[Minerva Armored Car|Minerva]]. The ''[[Oberste Heeresleitung]]'' decided to produce its own armoured vehicle and the manufacturing companies [[Ehrhardt E-V/4|Ehrhardt]], [[Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft|Daimler]] and Büssing were requested to develop an armoured car with [[all-wheel drive]]. 

During 1915, Büssing delivered the ordered prototype. In contrast to the Belgian armoured cars, the A5P was a massive vehicle, using a 'double-ended' layout that could at least pose a tactically useful high ground clearance. Its powerplant was Büssing's successful 6-cylinder truck engines. It had a large steel armoured body and was crewed by 10 men. 6 of the crew operated three 7.92&nbsp;mm [[machine gun]]s, usually the [[MG 08]] or [[Bergmann MG 15nA machine gun|MG 15nA]]. Some vehicles even received two 20&nbsp;mm [[cannon]]. 

In 1916, the A5P began production. Nevertheless, the German Army considered the Ehrhardt design more effective to fulfil the demanded operational tasks. As a result, production was stopped after three cars built. These A5P served in a column on the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]] until 1917.

The '''Mitsuoka Like''' (雷駆) is a five-door [[hatchback]] [[electric car]] produced by the [[Japan]]ese automaker [[Mitsuoka]] Motors since 2010.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} It is based on the [[Mitsubishi i MiEV]]. 

It was unveiled in 2010 and was discontinued in 2012. The wheelbase was extended to help accommodate five passengers, unlike the i Miev, which only seats four. Its distinctive front styling separates it from other rebadged i Mievs, including the Citroen C-Zero and the Peugeot Ion. It was priced at USD 55,000, before a Japanese tax credit, which lowered the priced to USD 14,550. 

The name "Like" is an indirect romanization of {{nihongo||雷駆|Raiku|literally "thunder drive"}}, which is a portmanteau of 雷 (thunder, referring to its electric powertrain) and 駆 (drive, more specifically drivetrain).

The '''GTA Spano''' is a Spanish [[supercar]] built in [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]] by the company [[GTA Motor]], a sister company to [[GTA Motor Competición]]. It began as a secret project in 2005, and was first released to the public in 2008 when the model was presented under the name of GTA Concept. The first units were manufactured and delivered at the end of 2010.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Since 2008, a large group of engineers worked on the project under the direction of Domingo Ochoa, who has over 15 years of experience in racing cars, a key point for the technical development of the vehicle. The car has several worldwide patents (five fully processed according to the last presentation of the company) and will make use of technology never before implemented in a Spanish vehicle.

In February 2008 a public and official presentation of the project was made through a model in the [[City of Arts and Sciences]] in Valencia. In August of that year, the first prototype began testing at the [[Circuit Ricardo Tormo]]. From 19 to 25 April 2010, the car was officially presented at the Top Marques Monaco lounge. The first units were manufactured and delivered at the end of 2010.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} Only 99 units will be built in order to maintain its exclusivity. Their production is carried out exclusively in [[Riba-roja de Túria]], the town where GTA Motor has established its main facilities.

The latest version of the car is set to be featured at the [[Geneva motor show#2013|2013 Geneva Motor Show]] with a {{convert|900|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} engine with 1000 Nm of torque, which has been electronically limited. 

The GTA Spano played a role in the 2014 film [[Need for Speed (film)|Need For Speed]].

==Technical specifications==
The chassis was made by combining [[carbon fibre]], [[titanium]], and [[Kevlar]], making it a benchmark in the industry. The Spano is powered by a supercharged version of the [[Dodge Viper]]'s V10 engine,<ref name=cdrev>{{cite web|url=http://www.goauto.com.au/mellor/mellor.nsf/story2/38E2759976E4BA62CA2575BB0025A5E9|title=Future Models - GTA 2010 Spano|work=GoAuto.com.au|accessdate=2009-05-19}}</ref> mounted in a rear longitudinal position and puts out 820&nbsp;hp and 960 Nm of torque.

The Spano is characterized by the exclusivity of its lines and its high performance. The car is known to reach an unofficial top speed in excess of {{convert|350|kph|mph|0|abbr=on}}, and 0–100&nbsp;kp/h takes less than three seconds.

The Spano has a good power-to-weight ratio of .62&nbsp;hp/kg (using bio-ethanol) and large wheels, namely 255/35R19 in the front and 335/30R20 at the rear, with [[Pirelli]] PZero tires as a standard option. Braking is carried out by six-piston calipers from [[AP Racing]] with a pneumatic [[Anti-lock braking system|ABS]] system and carbon-ceramic discs 380&nbsp;mm in diameter.

== Design ==
The exterior design was carried out by Valencian designer Sento Pallardó. Its panoramic glass roof, which has a patented system of opacity and lighting, gives a sense of spaciousness inside.

The '''Williams FW08''' was a [[Formula One]] car designed by [[Patrick Head]] which debuted at the [[1982 Belgian Grand Prix]] held at the [[Circuit Zolder|Zolder]] circuit. An evolution of the [[Williams FW07|FW07]] that it replaced, the car was used by [[Finland|Finnish]] driver [[Keke Rosberg]] to win the [[1982 Formula One season|1982]] [[List of Formula One World Drivers' Champions|World Drivers' Championship]].

The '''FW08B''' was a six-wheeled (4 driven wheels at the rear and 2 undriven wheels at the front) variant that originated from the [[Williams FW07|FW07D]] (also six-wheeled). It never raced. Patrick Head specifically said that the reason it was banned was because "someone in a FOCA meeting said it would drive up costs and cause chaos during pitstops". The FIA promptly limited the number of wheels for all cars to four, of which only 2 may be driven.<ref>http://www.yallaf1.com/2011/03/18/remembering-the-williams-f1-6-wheeler/</ref><ref>http://f1rejects.com/hall/beta/index.html</ref>

The car was updated for the [[1983 Formula One season]] to become the '''FW08C'''. Under new regulations all [[Ground effect in cars|ground effect]]s were out and flat bottom cars were in meaning nearly all the cars in F1 had to be heavily modified or replaced and the FW08 was no different. Against the turbo cars of [[Renault F1|Renault]], [[Brabham]] and [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]], Williams were not expected to do as well as they did. Rosberg opened the season with pole position at the [[1983 Brazilian Grand Prix|Brazilian Grand Prix]] (the last for a [[Cosworth DFY]] engined car) and scored the cars last win with a great drive at [[1983 Monaco Grand Prix|Monaco]]. He would eventually finish 5th in the Drivers' Championship while Williams would finish 1983 in 4th place, the best of the [[Cosworth]]-powered cars.

The FW08C also has the distinction of being the first Formula One car ever driven by [[Ayrton Senna]] at [[Donington Park]] in July 1983, after he badgered team boss Frank Williams for a test after being sat beside him on a flight. Senna completed 40 laps and lapped the circuit faster than anyone else had managed in the car, including 1983 race drivers Rosberg and [[Jacques Laffite]]. However, Williams team was not able to offer Senna a drive for {{f1|1984}} as Rosberg and Laffite were under contract and the [[Brazilian people|Brazilian]] signed to the [[Toleman]] team instead. Senna would not drive another Williams until he fatefully signed to drive for the team in {{f1|1994}}.

[[File:Williams FW08C Mont-Tremblant Esses.JPG|thumb|left|350px|A Williams FW08C, pictured in 2010. Note the much reduced sidepods in comparison to the earlier FW08 pictured above right.]]

The FW08C was retired after the [[1983 European Grand Prix]] at [[Brands Hatch]]. A third car was actually raced by the team at this race and was driven to 13th place by [[Jonathan Palmer]]. It was replaced by the [[Honda Racing F1|Honda]] powered [[Williams FW09|FW09]] for the last race of the season in [[1983 South African Grand Prix|South Africa]].

Early in 1983, Rosberg drove his FW08C to victory in the [[1983 Race of Champions|Race of Champions]] at Brands Hatch. To date this is the last non-championship Formula One race held.

In 1985 two FW08C were entered by PMC Motorsport in some races of the [[1985 International Formula 3000 season|Formula 3000 championship]], driven by [[Thierry Tassin]] and [[Lamberto Leoni]]. The results achieved were unremarkable apart from [[Lamberto Leoni]]'s third place in the [[Pau Grand Prix|Pau]] street race.

The '''Lola THL1''' was a [[Formula One]] racing car designed by [[Neil Oatley]] and [[John Baldwin (engineer)|John Baldwin]] for [[Haas Lola|Team Haas (USA) Ltd.]] during four of the last five races of the [[1985 Formula One season]]. The car used the {{Convert|750|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}, [[turbocharger|turbocharged]] [[Brian Hart Ltd.|Hart 415T]] [[Straight 4]] engine. The Haas Lola team only had one car for 1985 and it was driven by {{f1|1980}} World Champion [[Alan Jones (racing driver)|Alan Jones]], who was making a full-time comeback to Formula One at the age of 39.

==1985==
The THL1 maded its debut at the [[1985 Italian Grand Prix|Italian Grand Prix]] at [[Autodromo Nazionale Monza|Monza]], with Jones qualifying 25th, 9.859 seconds behind pole sitter [[Ayrton Senna]] ([[Lotus 97T|Lotus]]-[[Renault F1|Renault]]), but retiring after just 6 laps due to an overheating engine. The next race, the [[1985 Belgian Grand Prix|Belgian Grand Prix]], had been re-scheduled from June 2 so the team were not allowed to compete because they were not on the original entry list. Jones then qualified 18th for the [[1985 South African Grand Prix|South African Grand Prix]] which saw the French Renault and [[Equipe Ligier|Ligier]] teams boycott the race for political reasons, and the [[RAM Racing|RAM]] and [[Zakspeed]] teams not enter, but withdrew before the race due to illness (rumour had it that the Haas team had bowed to political pressure and withdrew, though Jones refutes this contending that he was indeed sick with the flu).

Jones showed the potential of the car in the final race of the season, the first ever [[Australian Grand Prix|Australian]] Formula One Grand Prix (the [[1985 Australian Grand Prix|1985 AGP]] was in fact the 50th running of the race, but it was the first time it was part of the [[FIA]] World Championship). The Australian qualified 19th for his home race but stalled the car at the start leaving him dead last. After getting a push start and being almost a quarter of a lap behind, Jones fought his way through the field and was up to 6th and into the points by lap 20 before being forced to retire with electrical trouble.

==1986==
The car was to be replaced for the start of the {{f1|1986}} season but the new [[Lola THL2]] was delayed meaning that the THL1 was pressed into service for the first three races of the season, its last race being the [[1986 San Marino Grand Prix|San Marino Grand Prix]]. Joining the [[Australian]] ex-World Champion in a second car was ex-[[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] and [[Renault F1|Renault]] driver, [[Frenchman]] [[Patrick Tambay]]. The car would still use the turbocharged Hart engine, but when the THL2 appeared in [[1986 San Marino Grand Prix|San Marino]] for Jones to drive, it was powered by the new, {{Convert|900|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] [[Cosworth#Other Formula One engines|TEC]] [[V6 engine|V6]] turbo designed by [[Keith Duckworth]], the designer of the highly successful [[Cosworth DFV]] engine. Neither Jones or Tambay would score a point with the Lola Hart THL1. Despite Jones praising the new car and its engine, the team had finally got some speed out of the THL1 with Tambay qualifying 11th, some 2.226 faster and 12 places better than Jones in the THL2.

Interestingly the car was called a Lola but its only connection to the famous [[Lola Cars]] was because of car owner [[Carl Haas]]'s previous close association with Lola founder [[Eric Broadley]], who was also named as chief engineer for the team in 1985. The THL1 was actually designed by Haas-owned design and construction company known as FORCE (a member of Neil Oatley's design team was an up-and-coming [[Ross Brawn]]). Lola however earned the team's points towards the Constructors Championships as the team's designated constructor.

During a 2012 interview series with Formula One legends, Alan Jones described the underpowered Hart 415T engine as like "sending a man to do a boys job", adding that it was an old [[Formula 2]] engine that someone had thrown a turbo on and said "lets go and do Formula One". Up against the financial and technical resources of Ferrari, Renault, [[Honda F1|Honda]], [[BMW in Formula One|BMW]] and [[Techniques d'Avant Garde|TAG]]-[[Porsche in Formula One|Porsche]], results were few and far between for those using [[Brian Hart]]'s engines. The THL1 was the last car to use the turbocharged Hart engine in Formula One.

The '''Lola THL2''' was a [[Formula One]] racing car designed by [[Neil Oatley]] for FORCE and was used by [[Haas Lola|Team Haas (USA) Ltd.]] during the [[1986 Formula One season]] (two of the FORCE aerodynamicists who worked on the car during its countless hours of [[Wind tunnel]] testing were a young Ross Brawn and Adrian Newey. The car debuted at the [[1986 San Marino Grand Prix]] and was driven by {{f1|1980}} [[List of Formula One World Drivers' Champions|World Drivers' Champion]] [[Alan Jones (racing driver)|Alan Jones]] from [[Australia]], and his new team mate [[Patrick Tambay]] of [[France]].

Jones, with 12 career wins in his first F1 career from 1975-81 (plus one race for [[Arrows Grand Prix International|Arrows]] in {{f1|1983}}), had been with the team since its debut at the [[1985 Italian Grand Prix]]. Tambay joined after two seasons driving for the factory [[Equipe Renault|Renault]] team, and a season and a half with [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] before that. Tabmay had 3 Grand Prix wins to his credit, all for Ferrari in {{f1|1982}} and 1983.

The car was an evolution of the [[Lola THL1]] which used the [[Brian Hart Ltd.|Hart 415T]] [[Straight 4]] [[turbocharger|turbo]]. When the THL2 appeared at Imola it was powered by the new [[Ford]] [[Cosworth#Other Formula One engines|TEC]], 120° [[V6]] turbo which was rated at about {{Convert|900|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}. Although it was an improvement in power over the {{Convert|750|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} Hart engine, the Ford unfortunately lagged behind other engines in F1 in 1986 such as the reported {{Convert|1300|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} bhp that the [[team Lotus|Lotus]] Renault V6 turbo had and the {{Convert|1400|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} of the turbocharged 4cyl [[BMW M12|BMW]] engine. This led to a frustrating season for both Jones and Tambay as the THL2 was generally regarded to be the best handling car of the season. Jones and Tambay were reported to have continually asked engine designer [[Keith Duckworth]] of [[Cosworth]] to build special qualifying engines with more power like Renault, BMW and [[Honda Racing F1|Honda]] were doing in order to be able to qualify the car further up the grid, but the requests were turned down. Duckworth, Ford and Cosworth all believed that their proven reliability record would hold them in good stead against their sometimes fragile opposition.

Jones only scored 4 points during the season and retired from F1 for good at season's end. Tambay only scored two points with 5th place in [[1986 Austrian Grand Prix|Austria]]. Tambay also departed F1 at season's end, as did the Lola Haas team following the withdrawal of their major sponsor [[Beatrice Foods]]. The THL2s best qualifying position was 6th by Tambay at the [[Hungaroring]] for the [[1986 Hungarian Grand Prix]] where the tight nature of the circuit meant a good handling car was more important than outright power.

Like its predecessor, the car was called a Lola but its only connection to the famous [[Lola Cars]] was because of car owner [[Carl Haas]]'s previous close association with Lola founder [[Eric Broadley]], who was also named as chief engineer for the team in 1985.

The '''Zakspeed 891''' was a [[Formula One]] car for the {{f1|1989}} season run by the [[Germany|German]] [[Zakspeed]] team. Its drivers were German [[Bernd Schneider (racing driver)|Bernd Schneider]] in his second year with the team and F1 rookie [[Aguri Suzuki]] from [[Japan]]. The car was powered by F1 newcomer [[Yamaha Motor Company|Yamaha]] who had produced the [[Yamaha Motor Company#Racing heritage|OX88]] [[V8 engine]] for exclusive use by Zakspeed in Formula One.

Due to neither Schneider nor his {{f1|1988}} team mate [[Piercarlo Ghinzani]] scoring any points in the [[Zakspeed 881|881]], the team was forced into [[Formula One racing#Pre-qualifying|pre-qualifying]] in order to be able to try to qualify for a race. While Schneider was able to qualify his car 25th for the [[1989 Brazilian Grand Prix]], it would prove to be a false hope with the German only able to pre-qualify and qualify once more, at the [[1989 Japanese Grand Prix]]. Suzuki never made it past pre-qualifying at any of the 16 rounds during the season.

Most of this was attributed to what was found to be a very underpowered Yamaha engine. Late in the season following another double failure to pre-qualify at the [[1989 Spanish Grand Prix|Spanish Grand Prix]], the Yamaha OX88 V8 was reported to be producing only {{Convert|560|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}.<ref>[http://www.statsf1.com/es/moteur-yamaha.aspx StatsF1 - Yamaha OX88]</ref> This compared badly to the base {{Convert|620|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} of the customer [[Cosworth DFR|Ford Cosworth]] and [[Judd (engine)#CV|Judd]] V8s and the [[Lamborghini V12|Lamborghini]] [[V12 engine|V12]] being used by most of the other teams. It was also unfavorable in comparison to the {{Convert|650|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} - {{Convert|700|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} bhp of the top four engines, the [[V10 engine|V10's]] of [[Honda Racing F1|Honda]] ([[McLaren]]) and [[Renault F1|Renault]] ([[WilliamsF1|Williams]]), the [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] [[V12 engine|V12]], and the [[Cosworth#Other Formula One engines|Ford]] V8 ([[Benetton Formula|Benetton]]). This made Schneider qualifying 21st for the following race in Japan all the more impressive.

The 891 was the last Formula One car to be produced by Zakspeed as the team pulled out of Grand Prix racing following the 1989 season. Yamaha also pulled out of Formula One at the end of the year, but would return with the [[Brabham]] team in {{f1|1991}}.

''Thrust1'' itself was never intended to be a contender for the record. Noble's plan was for three cars: ''Thrust1'' "to learn the ropes",<ref name="Noble, Thrust, three cars" >[[#Noble, Thrust|Noble, Thrust]], p.&nbsp;33</ref> a second demonstration car to raise interest and the essential large-scale sponsorship, then ''Thrust3'' for an attempt on the record.<ref name="Noble, Thrust, three cars" />

==Details==
The car was powered by a military-surplus [[Rolls-Royce Derwent]] engine, as the simplest jet engine available. The particular engine used was a Mk&nbsp;8 from a [[Gloster Meteor]]<ref group="notes" >Sourced from well-known surplus dealers, Portsmouth Marine Salvage</ref> of around 3,500 pounds thrust. The [[ladder chassis]] was also acquired as surplus, from Noble's employers [[GKN|GKN Sankey]]. The extremely tight project budget was initially funded by Noble selling his own car, a [[Triumph TR6]].<ref group="notes" >A chassis, incidentally, built in part of the same GKN Sankey plant</ref><ref name="Noble, Thrust, Thrust1" /> The direct costs of the project, estimated afterwards, were at around £1,500, including £1,100 for the TR6<ref name="Noble, Thrust, Thrust1 costs" >[[#Noble, Thrust|Noble, Thrust]], p.&nbsp;46</ref> Sponsorship was acquired from a variety of small agreements, including sponsorship-in-kind from the tool manufacturer [[Black & Decker]]. Construction began in the garage of Noble's flat in [[Thames Ditton]]. By 1975, the car was completed in a [[lock-up garage]] at [[Turnham Green]].<ref name="Noble, Thrust, Thrust1" />

The first test run was at [[RAF St Athan]] in South Wales. This was little more than a shakedown at low power, and no more than 80&nbsp;mph. A demonstration run for filming was also made around the circuit at [[Brands Hatch]]. Runs were also conducted at [[RNAY Wroughton]] near Swindon. By 1977 the team were ready for a high-speed run, planned for the long 10,000&nbsp;foot runway of [[RAF Fairford]]<ref name="Noble, Thrust, Thrust1" />

The first high-speed run was planned for 7 March 1977, the day after Noble's thirty-first birthday.<ref name="Noble, Thrust, Thrust1" /> A successful first run was made from a standing start at idle thrust and gradual acceleration, reaching an estimated top speed of 180&nbsp;mph. The second run was planned to be a drag start, with thrust built up against the brakes and then released. At around 140&nbsp;mph though, a rear-wheel bearing seized<ref group="notes" >The rear axle was from a normal production road car, including its differential casing and drum brakes.</ref> and the car went sideways, then rolled. The triple roll was mostly airborne and the car landed on its side, with relatively little damage. Noble was unhurt. The Derwent engine, and its protruding combustion chambers, took much of the damage. The jetpipe broke loose and at least one combustion chamber was crumpled.<ref name="Noble, Thrust, Thrust1" />

The car never ran again, and the wreckage was sold to a scrap dealer for £175, after parts had been removed to ensure that it ''could'' never be run again.<ref name="Noble, Thrust, Thrust1 costs" /> Despite the crash, Noble was not disheartened and saw this as the conclusion of the first step of his original plan.<ref name="Noble, Thrust, three cars" />

==Successor==

By October of the same year, an engine had already been acquired for the next project, ''[[Thrust2]]'' and this [[Rolls-Royce Avon]] was displayed at the London [[Motorfair]] to raise interest and sponsorship.<ref name="Noble, Thrust, Thrust2" >[[#Noble, Thrust|Noble, Thrust]], p.&nbsp;51</ref>

The '''Toleman TG185''' was a [[Formula One]] racing car designed by [[Rory Byrne]] and was used by [[Toleman|Toleman Motorsport]] during the majority [[1985 Formula One season]]. The car was powered by the {{Convert|800|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} [[Brian Hart Ltd.|Hart 415T]] [[Straight 4]] [[turbocharger|turbocharged]] engine. The car was late in arriving for the 1985 season for no other reason than a lack of tyres. In {{f1|1984}} Toleman started the season using tyres supplied by [[Italy|Italian]] company [[Pirelli]]. Part way through the season though the team pulled out of their tyre contract with Pirelli and started using the [[France|French]] [[Michelin]]s instead. However, when Michelin pulled out of F1 at the end of 1984, the team were unable to come to an agreement to use [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear]] rubber. They were also unable to get a deal with Pirelli who were reluctant to supply tyres for the team. It was only after team sponsor [[Benetton Group|Benetton]] bought [[Spirit Racing]] and transferred their Pirelli contract to Toleman that the team were able to run in 1985.

The car was fundamentally unchanged from the [[Toleman TG184|TG184]] apart from a revised suspension to deal with running different rubber and revised rear bodywork. The car was initially driven by former [[Brabham]] driver [[Teo Fabi]] of Italy. He was joined in the team from the 10th race ([[1985 Austrian Grand Prix|Austria]]) by fellow Italian [[Piercarlo Ghinzani]]. Fabi gave the Toleman Team its first and only pole position when he qualified on pole for the [[1985 German Grand Prix|German Grand Prix]] held at the new [[Nürburgring]] circuit. Fabi set his time in the Friday qualifying session and as it rained on the Saturday no one else could beat his time. Unfortunately he got a bad start in the race due to a slipping clutch and was only 10th going into the first corner. The clutch would be the cause of the car's retirement from the race on lap 29.

The TG185 was the last F1 car for Toleman Group Motorsport. From the {{f1|1986}} season the team was bought out by main sponsor Benetton and renamed [[Benetton Formula|Benetton Formula Ltd.]] Fabi's pole in Germany was the highlight of the year. After finishing 1984 in 7th place in the Constructors' Championship with 16 points (including 3 podiums by rookie driver [[Ayrton Senna]]), the team failed to score a point in 1985. In fact, the TG185 proved almost totally unreliable with only 2 finishes all season when Fabi finished 14th in [[1985 French Grand Prix|France]] and 12th in [[1985 Italian Grand Prix|Italy]], while Ghinzani failed to finish a race.

Following the acquisition of Toleman the planned {{f1|1986}} car, dubbed the "TG186", was simply renamed the [[Benetton B186]]. That car, powered by the {{Convert|1400|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} [[BMW M12]] engine went on to became the team's first ever Grand Prix winner when [[Gerhard Berger]] drove it to victory at the [[1986 Mexican Grand Prix]].

The '''Benetton B187''' was a [[Formula One]] racing car designed by [[Rory Byrne]] and raced by [[Benetton Formula|Benetton]] team in the [[1987 Formula One season]]. The B187 replaced the [[Benetton B186|B186]] used in the {{f1|1986}} season.

In 1987 Benetton effectively became the [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] works team in F1 as they had exclusive use of the [[turbocharger|turbocharged]] [[Ford]] [[Cosworth#Other Formula One engines|TEC]] [[V6 engine]] for 1987, rated at approximately {{Convert|900|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}. Driven by [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[Thierry Boutsen]] and [[Italy|Italian]] [[Teo Fabi]], the team and the B187 got off to a good start with Boutsen finishing 5th at the season opening [[1987 Brazilian Grand Prix|Brazilian Grand Prix]] and by mid-season both Fabi and Boutsen were regularly challenging the top 4 teams of [[McLaren]], [[WilliamsF1|Williams]], [[Team Lotus|Lotus]] and [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] for podium finishes. Boutsen led the [[1987 Mexican Grand Prix|Mexican Grand Prix]] (the race the team had won in [[1986 Mexican Grand Prix|1986]]) before being forced to retire.

Boutsen finished the season in 8th place with 16 points while Fabi, in his last year in F1, was 9th with 12 points scored. Overall with the B187, Benetton finished 5th in the constructors championship with 28 points. For Benetton this was a 9 point and 1 place improvement on the 1986 season, although unlike 1986, the team did not win a race in 1987.

The B187 was the last of the turbo cars produced by Benetton (dating back to when [[Toleman]] produced its first car, the TG181 in {{f1|1981}}) and was replaced in {{f1|1988}} by the [[Naturally aspirated engine|Naturally aspirated]], [[Cosworth DFR|Ford DFR]], [[V8 engine|V8]] powered [[Benetton B188|B188]]. The B188 would the first car constructed by the team, either as Toleman or Benetton, that would not be powered by a turbocharged engine.

The B187 was driven by [[Jackie Stewart]] in 1989 as part of a show where he drove a number of race cars, including several Formula One machines, and declared it to be one of the better cars he drove. The B187 was the last F1 car driven by Teo Fabi, the Italian being pushed out of the team for 1988 with the signing of fellow Italian [[Alessandro Nannini]]. With no offers for a drive in 1988, Fabi's last race for the team was the [[1987 Australian Grand Prix|Australian Grand Prix]]. It was at this race that a disgruntled Fabi deliberately held up Boutsen from lapping him for several laps despite repeated pit board signs and radio messages to let his team mate past.

The '''March 871''' was a [[Formula One]] [[racing car]] designed by the [[March Engineering|March Racing Team]] and driven in the [[1987 Formula One season]]. The car was powered by a [[Cosworth DFZ]] V8 engine, and was driven by the [[1986 International Formula 3000 season|1986 International Formula 3000]] champion, Italian [[Ivan Capelli]].

The team was sponsored by Japanese real estate company [[Leyton House]].

The 871 chassis was not ready for the first race in [[1987 Brazilian Grand Prix|Brazil]]. So the team used an F3000/F1 hybrid called the 87P. The 871 was ready for the second race in [[1987 San Marino Grand Prix|San Marino]].

The best result and the only points were achieved with a 6th place at the [[1987 Monaco Grand Prix]]. However Capelli and the March 871 did finish 4th in the Colin Chapman Trophy for constructors of cars equipped with naturally aspirated engines.

'''Delahaye 135''' was an automobile manufactured by [[Delahaye]]. Designed by young engineer Jean François, it was produced from 1935 until 1954 in many different [[Car body style|body styles]]. A sporting tourer, it was also popular for racing.<ref name="1930s Cars">{{cite book | title = A-Z of Cars of the 1930s | last = Sedgwick | first = Michael | last2 = Gillies | first2 = Mark | publisher = Bay View Books | year = 1989 | pages = 66–67 | location = Bideford, Devon, UK | isbn = 1-870979-38-9 }}</ref>

==History==
The Delahaye 135, also known as "''Coupe des Alpes''" after its success in the [[Alpine Rally]], was first presented in 1935 and signified Delahaye's decision to build sportier cars than before. The 3.2-litre [[overhead valve]] straight-six with four-bearing [[crankshaft]] was derived from one of Delahaye's truck engines and was also used in the more sedate, longer wheelbase ({{convert|3160|mm|in|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}) Delahaye '''138'''. Power was {{convert|95|hp|kW|abbr=on}} in twin carburetor form,<ref name="Rousseau">{{Cite book | title = Guide de l'Automobile Française | last = Rousseau | first = Jacques | last2 = Caron | first2 = Jean-Paul | publisher = Solar | year = 1988 | chapter = 128 | location = Paris | isbn = 2-263-01105-6 }}</ref> but {{convert|110|hp|kW|abbr=on}} were available in a version with three downdraught [[Solex#Carburetors|Solex]] carbs,<ref name="1930s Cars"/> offering a {{convert|148|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} top speed. The 138 had a single carburetor and {{convert|76|hp|kW|abbr=on}}, and was available in a sportier {{convert|90|hp|kW|abbr=on}} iteration.<ref>Rousseau & Caron, "127".</ref>

The 135 featured independent, [[leaf-sprung]] front suspension, a [[Live axle|live rear axle]], and cable operated [[Bendix Corporation|Bendix]] brakes. 17-inch spoked wheels were also standard. Transmission was either a partially [[Synchromesh|synchronized]] four-speed manual or four-speed [[Preselector gearbox|Cotal pre-selector]] [[Transmission (mechanics)|transmission]].<ref>Hull, Peter. "Delahaye: Famous on Road and Race Track", in Ward, Ian, executive editor. ''World of Automobiles'' (London: Orbis, 1974), Volume 5, p.523.</ref>

Competition 135s set the all-time record at the [[Ulster Tourist Trophy]] and placed second and third in the ''[[Mille Miglia]]'' in 1936,<ref>Hull, p.522.</ref> and the [[1938 24 Hours of Le Mans]].<ref>Hull, p.524.</ref>

The list of independent body suppliers offering to clothe the 135 chassis is the list of France's top [[Coachbuilding|coachbuilder]]s of the time, including [[Figoni & Falaschi]], [[Letourneur et Marchand]], Guilloré, [[Marcel Pourtout]], Frères Dubois, [[Saoutchik|J Saoutchik]], [[Franay]], Antem and [[Henri Chapron]].<ref name=Automobilia1948>{{cite journal| authorlink = René Bellu  | title =Automobilia| journal = Toutes les voitures françaises 1948 (salon Paris oct 1947)| volume = Nr. 7| pages = Pages 26–35|year = 1998|isbn = |publisher=Histoire & collections|location=Paris }}</ref>

Production of the 3.2-litre version ended with the [[German occupation of France during World War II|German occupation]] in 1940 and was not taken up again after the end of hostilities.

===135M===
[[File:1949 Delahaye type 148 L Berline front.jpg|thumb|left|1949 '''148L''' with four-door ''berline'' bodywork by [[Letourneur et Marchand]]]]
[[File:135dub7.jpg|thumb|The special version ''Gascogne'' (1948).]]

A larger-[[Engine displacement|displacement]] (3,557&nbsp;cc) 135M was introduced in 1936. Largely the same as the regular 135, the new engine offered 90, 105, or 115&nbsp;hp with either one, two, or three carburetors.<!-->Peter Hull, in"Delahaye: Famous on Road and Race Track", in Ward, Ian, executive editor. ''World of Automobiles'' (London: Orbis, 1974), Volume 5, p.523, says up to 130hp.--> As with the 135/138, a less sporty, longer wheelbase version was also built, called the "148". The 148 had a 3,150&nbsp;mm wheelbase, or 3,350&nbsp;mm in a seven-seater version. On the two shorter wheelbases, a [[Delahaye 134|134]]N was also available, with a 2,150&nbsp;cc four-cylinder version of the 3.2-litre six from the 135. Along with a brief return of the 134, production of 148, 135M, and 135MS models was resumed after the end of the war. The 135 and 148 were then joined by the larger engined [[Delahaye 175|175, 178, and 180 derivatives]]. The 135M continued to be available alongside the newer [[Delahaye 235|235]] until the demise of Delahaye in 1954.

====168====
Presented in December 1938 and built until the outbreak of war in 1940, the Type 168 used the 148L's chassis and engine (engine code 148N) in [[:fr:Renault Viva Grand Sport|Renault Viva Grand Sport]] bodywork. Wheelbase remained 315&nbsp;cm while the use of [[artillery wheel]]s rather than spoked items meant minor differences in track. This curious hybrid was the result of an effort by Renault to steal in on Delahaye's lucrative near monopoly on fire vehicles: after a complaint by Delahaye, Renault relinquished contracts it had gained, but in return Delahaye had to agree to purchase a number of Viva Grand Sport bodyshells. In an effort to limit the market of this [[Brood parasite|cuckoo's egg]], thus limiting the number of bodyshells it had to purchase from Renault, Delahaye chose to equip it with the unpopular [[Preselector gearbox#Wilson gearbox|Wilson preselector]] (even though the marketing material referred to the Cotal version). This succeeded very well, and with the war putting a stop to car production, no more than thirty were supposedly built. Strong, wide, and fast, like their Viva Grand Sport half sisters, the 168s proved popular with the army. Many were equipped to run on [[Wood gas generator|''gazogène'']] during the war and very few (if any) remain.<ref>{{Cite journal | title = Un tiroir de l'inconnu: La Delahaye 168 | trans_title = A drawer of the unknown: The Delahaye 168 | last = Jolly | first = François | language = French | editor-last = Pozzoli | editor-first = Serge | date = July 1978 | journal = Le Fanatique de l'Automobile | issue = 118 | page = 18 | publisher = Editions Larivière | location = Paris | issn = 0336-9072 }}</ref>

===135MS===
[[File:Delahaye 135MS Competition.JPG|thumb|Short wheelbase 135MS (1937)]]

An even sportier version, the 135MS, soon followed; 120–145&nbsp;hp were available, with competition versions offering over 160&nbsp;hp.<ref name="1930s Cars"/> The 135MS was the version most commonly seen in competition, and continued to be available until 1954, when new owners [[Hotchkiss et Cie|Hotchkiss]] finally called a halt. The MS had the 2.95&nbsp;m wheelbase, but competition models sat on a shortened 2.70&nbsp;m chassis.

The [[Delahaye 235|type 235]], a rebodied 135MS with ponton-style design by [[Philippe Charbonneaux]], appeared in 1951.

==Competition==
The 135 was successful as racing car during the late 1930s, winning the [[Monte Carlo rally]] 1937 and [[24 Hours of Le Mans]] in 1938.<ref>{{cite web|author=the Auto Editors of Consumer Guide |url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1936-delahaye-135-competition-coupe.htm |title=Howstuffworks: 1936 Delahaye 135 Competition Coupé |publisher=Auto.howstuffworks.com |date=2007-10-29 |accessdate=2011-09-25}}</ref> The Le Mans victory, with Chaboud and Trémoulet at the wheel, was decisive, with two more Delahayes coming in second and fourth. A regular 135 came seventh at the 1935 Le Mans, and in 1937 135MS came in second and third. Appearing again in 1939, two 135MS made it to sixth and eighth place, and again after the war the now venerable 135MS finished in 5th, 9th, and 10th.<ref name="Rousseau"/>

The '''Tyrrell DG016''' was a [[Formula One]] racing car designed by [[Maurice Philippe]] and [[Brian Lisles]]. It was built and raced by [[Tyrrell Racing]] in the [[1987 Formula One season]], using a customer [[Cosworth DFZ]] engine. The "DG" in the car's name was a reference to the team's major sponsor, [[Data General]].

The DG016 made its debut at the opening race of the [[1987 Formula One season]] and would be part of two different championships. For 1987 only there would be the [[Colin Chapman]] Trophy (for constructors of cars equipped with [[naturally aspirated engines]]). In this championship the Tyrrell DG016 was a major success finishing 1st by over 100 points from the [[Larrousse]]-Calmels Team (helped by Tyrrell being the only two car 'atmo' team to run both cars for the entire season). Drivers [[Jonathan Palmer]] and [[Philippe Streiff]] would have finished on the naturally aspirated podium at all 16 rounds of the season.

The car was also successful in the full Constructors' Championship with 6th place, including points finishes for Palmer in [[1987 Monaco Grand Prix|Monaco]] and [[1987 Australian Grand Prix|Australia]], for Streiff in [[1987 French Grand Prix|France]], and remarkably for both drivers in [[1987 German Grand Prix|Germany]] at the fast [[Hockenheimring]] circuit whose long straights did not suit the 'atmo' cars (largely thanks to 13 of the 18 turbo runners failing to finish due to either engine or turbo failure). The result in Germany was even more remarkable considering that Streiff and Palmer qualified 22nd and 23rd respectively, with Streiff 10.912 seconds slower than the pole time set by [[Nigel Mansell]] in his [[Williams FW11|Williams]]-[[Honda F1|Honda]] turbo, while the fastest race lap for the DG016, again set by Streiff, was 8.512 seconds slower than Mansell's fastest lap of the race. Despite being significantly slower than the turbos, both Tyrrells only finished one lap behind race winner and 1987 World Champion [[Nelson Piquet]] in his Williams-Honda.

These results helped place Tyrrell above such turbo powered teams as [[Arrows Grand Prix International|Arrows]] (7th) and [[Brabham]] (8th) in the open Constructors' Championship.

The DG016 was replaced for the [[1988 Formula One season]] by the equally unsuccessful [[Tyrrell 017]].

The '''Zakspeed 881''' was a [[Formula One]] car designed by Chris Murphy and Heinz Zollner and raced by [[Zakspeed]] in the [[1988 Formula One season]]. The car was the last to be powered by the team's own 1.5 litre [[straight 4]] [[turbo]] engine, the '''1500/4'''. The car was driven by veteran [[Piercarlo Ghinzani]] and [[West Germany|West German]] F1 rookie [[Bernd Schneider (racing driver)|Bernd Schneider]].

The 881 was a development of the team's {{f1|1987}} car, the [[Zakspeed 871|871]], and was a largely unsuccessful car in the last year for turbos in Formula One. Both Ghinzani and Schneider, who replaced 1987 drivers [[Martin Brundle]] and [[Christian Danner]], struggled all season to qualify the car even against the slower [[Naturally aspirated engine|atmospheric]] cars. A glaring example of this was at [[Silverstone Circuit|Silverstone]] for the [[1988 British Grand Prix|British Grand Prix]]. At the fastest circuit on the calendar that should have suited the turbo powered cars, both Ghinzani and Schneider failed to qualify, the Zakspeeds being the only turbo cars not to do so. The 881 was also unreliable, often blowing either the engine or the turbo many times over a race weekend. Neither Zakspeed driver scored a point in 1988, which meant the team was forced to pre-qualify in {{f1|1989}}.

The 881 was the last F1 car in which Zakspeed used their own engines which were rated at about {{Convert|640|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} for the season. While this made the engine one of the most powerful in the field, being only about 10 bhp shy of both the [[Honda F1|Honda]] and [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] [[V6 engine]]s, and around the same as the other straight 4 turbo in the field, the [[BMW M12|Megatrons]] used by [[Arrows Grand Prix International|Arrows]], that is where the similarities ended. Honda powered [[McLaren]] to 15 wins and 15 pole positions during the season, with the other win and pole going to Ferrari. Ghinzani failed to qualify on seven occasions while Schneider failed to qualify ten times.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gurneyflap.com/zakspeedengine.html |title=Zakspeed F1 Engines at |publisher=Gurneyflap.com |accessdate=2012-01-07}}</ref> Something that did not help the team's cause was the weight of the car. The 881 weighed in at {{convert|560|kg|lb||abbr=on}}, this was around {{convert|20|kg|lb||abbr=on}} heavier than the [[McLaren MP4/4]], [[Ferrari F1/87|Ferrari F1/87/88C]] and the Honda powered [[Lotus 100T]].

Bernd Schneider recorded the team's best finish for the year when he finished 12th in his and the team's home race in [[1988 German Grand Prix|Germany]] at [[Hockenheimring|Hockenheim]]. The German rookie had to wait until Round 4 in [[1988 Mexican Grand Prix|Mexico]] to qualify for his first race. There at the [[Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez]] in the high altitude of [[Mexico City]] where the thinner air gave the turbos a massive power advantage over their atmospheric rivals (the 'atmos' lost a reported 25% of their power at altitude while the turbos lost around 5%), Schneider qualified in an encouraging 15th place and ran well early on the edge of the top 10 until retiring with engine failure on lap 16.

The 881's replacement, the [[Zakspeed 891]], would be powered by a [[Yamaha Motor Company#Racing heritage|Yamaha]] [[V8 engine]].

The '''Zakspeed 871''' was a [[Formula One]] car designed by Chris Murphy and Heinz Zollner and raced by [[Zakspeed]] in the [[1987 Formula One season]]. The car was powered by the team's own 1.5 litre, 1500/4 [[straight 4]] [[turbo]] engine, which was rated at about {{Convert|920|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} for the season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gurneyflap.com/zakspeedengine.html |title=Zakspeed F1 Engines at |publisher=Gurneyflap.com |accessdate=2012-01-07}}</ref> [[Martin Brundle]] had moved after 3 years at [[Tyrrell Racing|Tyrrell]] to be Zakspeed's lead driver, in a virtual driver swap with [[Jonathan Palmer]], who had left Zakspeed after two seasons to drive for Tyrrell. Brundle was joined by former [[1985 International Formula 3000 season|Formula 3000]] champion [[Christian Danner]], who had moved from [[Arrows Grand Prix International|Arrows]].

After using the [[Zakspeed 861|861]] for the first race in [[1987 Brazilian Grand Prix|Brazil]], the 871 made its debut in Brundle's hands at the [[1987 San Marino Grand Prix|San Marino Grand Prix]] where he qualified 15th and scored 2 points for finishing 5th. This happened to be the only time that Zakspeed would ever score a point during their time in Formula One.

The 871 was replaced for the {{f1|1988}} season by the team's last ever turbo car, the [[Zakspeed 881]] which would be again powered by the team's own turbocharged engine.

The team's main sponsor was German tobacco company [[West (cigarette)|West]].

'''Citroën Survolt''' is a concept [[electric car|electric]] [[race car|racing car]] produced by [[Citroën]] and presented at the 2010 [[Geneva Motor Show]].

==Overview==
The Survolt is a compact-sized racing car based on the concept car [[Citroën Revolte]] presented at the 2009 [[Frankfurt Motor Show]]. Because the car runs on batteries, it is classed as a [[Zero-emissions vehicle]].

==Design==
The Survolt is 3.85 meters (12.63&nbsp;feet) long, 1.87 meters (6.14&nbsp;feet) wide and 1.20 meters (3.94&nbsp;feet) high and features a design with the front dominated by the vehicle's badge located above the large oval-shaped grille.

The car has horizontal [[LED light|LED]] [[headlamp]]s which have lower power consumption than traditional filament bulbs — important in a battery-operated vehicle.

At the back, the Survolt maintains the light cluster design used on the REVOLTe, and has a [[Spoiler (automotive)|spoiler]] to increase rear downforce.

An Art Car based on the Survolt has been designed with the collaboration of  [[Françoise Nielly]] in 2011.

==Engine and drivetrain==
The Survolt is powered by a pair of [[electric motor]]s with a combined power output of {{convert|300|bhp|abbr=on}}.  Its top speed is {{convert|260|km/h|abbr=on}}, and it can accelerate from 0–{{convert|100|km/h|abbr=on}} in less than 5 seconds. Citroën claims that the batteries provide a range of {{convert|200|km|mi|abbr=on}}.{{cn|date=February 2015}}

==Motorsports==
The Citroën Survolt made its first appearance on a [[racetrack]] at [[Le Mans]] on 12 July 2010. [[Vanina Ickx]] was the first driver to get behind the wheel of the Survolt.

Although it has not been confirmed that the Survolt will ever be produced, there are rumors that Citroën wants to create a limited-production of a [[compact car|compact]]-sized concept based on this car, and start a [[one-make racing]] series. The Citroën Survolt will be produced in 2018 as a production car.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}

==Media appearances==
The Citroën Survolt makes an appearance in ''[[Asphalt 6: Adrenaline]]'', ''[[Asphalt 8: Airborne]]'' and ''GT Racing 2'', all of which are mobile racing games by [[Gameloft]]. The Survolt is also on a mobile, or Facebook, racing game called Racing Rivals by [[Glu Mobile]]. It is also available on [[Driveclub]] for [[PlayStation 4]] as a free [[downloadable content]].

The British automobile test driving show Top Gear has driven the car around their famous test track and has given it high marks except for the fact that it is exceptionally hard to climb in and out of.<ref name="Top Gear">http://www.topgear.com/uk/car-news/tg-drives-the-citroen-survolt</ref>

The '''Tyrrell 015''' was a [[Formula One]] car designed for [[Tyrrell Racing]] by [[Maurice Philippe]] for use in the {{f1|1986}} season. The cars were powered by the turbocharged [[Renault F1|Renault EF15]] [[V6 engine]] which was rated at {{Convert|850|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} in race trim. The 015 ran on [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear]] tyres and were driven by [[Martin Brundle]] in his third season with the team, and [[Philippe Streiff]] who joined from [[Equipe Ligier|Ligier]].

The 015 was a development of the team's first ever turbo car, the [[Tyrrell 014]] which had first run the Renault turbo in Brundle's hands at the [[1985 French Grand Prix]]. As the 015 was still unfinished at the start of the season, the team ran the 014 for the first three races of the season. The new car was finally ready for [[1986 Monaco Grand Prix|Monaco]] and proved to be somewhat reliable, if not the fastest car on the grid. Of the three teams which used versions of the turbocharged Renault V6 during the season, Tyrrell were usually slower than both Ligier and [[Team Lotus|Lotus]]. This was usually explained by Lotus having a works contract to run the latest engines (as well as having the undisputed fastest driver in Grand Prix racing, Brundle's old [[British Formula 3 Championship|British F3]] rival [[Ayrton Senna]]), while the French Ligier team had been using the French engines since {{f1|1984}}. Tyrrell on the other hand, had a failed relationship with Renault during the early 1970s which prompted the factory to eventually form its own team in {{f1|1977}}, only had a contract to run customer engines which were usually the oldest, least powerful and economical of those on offer.

The car's best result wasn't achieved until the final race of the season in [[1986 Australian Grand Prix|Australia]] when Brundle finished in 4th place despite running out of fuel as he crossed the line. He had actually inherited 4th from his team mate when Streiff ran out of fuel on the previous lap. Streiff was still classified in 5th place. Brundle also scored the team's best starting position for the year when he qualified 10th for the car's debut at Monaco.

The 015 made headlines for the wrong reasons at the [[1986 French Grand Prix|French Grand Prix]] when Streiff's car caught fire in front of the pits on lap 43. Despite the car being on fire directly beyond the pit wall the marshals fire truck took nearly a minute to get to it which gave enough time for the car to be burnt beyond repair.

This was the last turbo powered car run by Tyrrell in Formula One. After losing their Renault engines when the factory pulled out of Formula One altogether at the end of 1986, the team reverted to using [[Cosworth]] power when they ran the 3.0 litre [[Cosworth DFZ|Ford Cosworth DFZ]] [[V8 engine]] in their {{f1|1987}} car, the [[Tyrrell DG016|DG016]].

The '''Ligier JS29''' was a [[Formula One]] car designed by [[Michel Tétu]] and [[Michel Beaujon]] for the [[Equipe Ligier|Ligier]] team for use in the {{f1|1987}} season. It was originally developed for use with an Alfa Romeo turbo power plant but prior to the start of the season, Ligier lost the use of the engine. The car had to be re-designed around a [[BMW M12|Megatron]] [[Straight 4]] [[Turbocharger|turbo]] engine. Redesignated the '''JS29B''', it scored a single point during the season when driver [[Rene Arnoux]] finished 6th in the [[1987 Belgian Grand Prix|Belgian Grand Prix]]. Later in the season, the car was further refined to a '''JS29C''' specification.

==Development==
The JS29 was originally to be powered by a brand new turbocharged [[Alfa Romeo in Formula One#Time after constructor years|Alfa-Romeo 415T]] 4-cylinder engine. However, during pre-season testing lead driver [[René Arnoux]] compared the engine to used food which gave Alfa's parent company [[Fiat]] the excuse they had been looking for to pull the plug on the project. It was reported at the time that Fiat did not want Alfa Romeo involved in Formula One as a competitor to [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] who at that stage they part-owned.

As a result of losing their engine supply so close to the start of the season, Ligier had to come up with an engine in order to compete. The team managed to get a supply of [[BMW M12|Megatron]] [[Straight 4]] [[Turbocharger|turbo]] engines for the season (the Megatron engine was the old [[BMW M12]] engine formerly used by such teams as [[Brabham]]. They had been acquired from [[BMW]] by [[Arrows Grand Prix International|Arrows]] major sponsor, American insurance company [[USF&G]], and were re-branded ''Megatron'' for 1987 and {{f1|1988}}). The updated car with the Megatron engine was now designated the '''JS29B'''. Arnoux was retained for the season and he was joined by [[Italian people|Italian]] veteran [[Piercarlo Ghinzani]].

The JS29 should have made its debut at the [[1987 Brazilian Grand Prix]] using the Alfa Romeo 890T [[V8 engine|V8]] turbo until the 415T was ready. However, following Arnoux's unfavourable comments, and Fiat's withdrawal, this meant that the team had no engine with which to compete until the second race in [[1987 San Marino Grand Prix|San Marino]]. It was there that the JS29B with its Megatron engine would make its competition debut. The JS29B was updated following the [[1987 Detroit Grand Prix|Detroit Grand Prix]] to its final JS29C specifications. While the JS29 was originally designed for the 4-cylinder Alfa engine, it wasn't simply a case of slotting in the replacement Megatron 4-cylinder in its place. Major differences in the 'plumbing' of the two engines caused the team to have to redesign the car, including its rear suspension, as the Megatron was causing bad vibrations which was causing suspension failures.

As a result of the late start to the season due to their switch of engines, the Megatron powered Ligiers were never close to the pace of the [[Arrows A10]]-Megatrons of [[Derek Warwick]] and former Ligier driver [[Eddie Cheever]].

==Race history==
Arnoux placed his JS29B in 13th place in qualifying for the team's first race of the year at San Marino but failed to start the race following an accident in practice. Ghinzani was 19th and withdrew from the race with handling issues. At the next race, the [[1987 Belgian Grand Prix|Belgian Grand Prix]], both cars were classified with Arnoux in sixth place for the team's sole point of the year. Ghinzani was 7th although out of fuel and this proved to be his best finish of the year.

The JS29C was introduced at the team's [[1987 French Grand Prix|home grand prix]] in France with Arnoux qualifying in 13th place on the grid. As with Ghinzani, he failed to finish the race itself. The cars usually qualified in the lower half of the grid, with Arnoux outperforming Ghinzani.  The best qualifying achieved was Arnoux's 12th at the [[1987 German Grand Prix|German Grand Prix]].

The JS29C was Ligier's last turbo-powered car. It was replaced in the {{f1|1988}} season by the [[Judd (engine)#CV|Judd CV]] V8 powered [[Ligier JS31]].

The '''Ligier JS31''' was a [[Formula One]] car designed by [[Michel Tétu]] and [[Michel Beaujon]] for the [[Equipe Ligier|Ligier]] team for use in the [[1988 Formula One season]]. It was powered by the new, [[Naturally-aspirated engine|normally aspirated]], 3.5L [[Judd (engine)#CV|Judd CV]] [[V8 engine]] and, like the rest of the F1 grid in 1988, ran on [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear]] tyres. Drivers for the team were French veteran [[René Arnoux]] in his 3rd season driving for team boss [[Guy Ligier]], and Swede [[Stefan Johansson]] who had finished 5th in the World Championship with [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] in {{f1|1986}} and 6th with [[McLaren]] in {{f1|1987}}.

The JS31 was the first non-[[Turbocharger|turbo]] car produced by Ligier since the [[Cosworth DFV]] powered [[Ligier JS21|JS21]] used in the {{f1|1983}} season, and it proved to be very uncompetitive despite the best efforts of the team and its experienced drivers. The car's major failure was a lack of downforce with Johansson in particular reporting several times during a frustrating season that he had to drive the car as if on a wet track because it had so little grip and this was reflected in the car's results. Johansson, a frequent podium visitor in the previous three seasons, failed to qualify six times and never finished above 9th while seven time grand prix winner Arnoux failed to qualify twice ([[1988 San Marino Grand Prix|San Marino]] and [[1988 French Grand Prix|France]]) and never finished a race higher than 10th. Neither driver qualified for the San Marino Grand Prix, the first time in team history that neither Ligier made the grid.

The French Grand Prix at [[Paul Ricard Circuit|Paul Ricard]] proved to be the lowest point of the season for the French team. On the eve of Arnoux's 40th birthday (celebrated the day after the race), neither Arnoux nor Johansson qualified for the team's home Grand Prix, something that did not please the team's owner [[Guy Ligier]], though as one team member pointed out thankfully he was not actually at Paul Ricard that weekend.

Ligier did not score a point during 1988, their worst season since [[1983 Formula One season|1983]], when they also failed to score. On several occasions both Johansson and Arnoux struggled to outqualify [[1987 International Formula 3000 season|1987 Formula 3000]] champion [[Stefano Modena]] and [[Sports car racing|sportscar]] driver, 33 year old [[Argentine]] [[Oscar Larrauri]] (an F1 rookie) in the equally uncompetitive [[EuroBrun]] (the EuroBrun team were F1 'rookies' in 1988, though Modena, who had made his debut with [[Brabham]] in 1987, was seen at that stage as a future star of the sport...if he could get a competitive drive). In an effort to optimise the weight distribution of the car, it was designed with an unusual and heavy arrangement of fuel tanks: there were two cells either side of the driver, another between the driver and the engine and a fourth between the engine and gearbox.<ref>Hodges (1990) p.134</ref>

Ligier only had both cars qualify for a race on 10 occasions in 1988. On 5 of those occasions both cars failed to finish.

The JS31 was replaced for 1989 by the [[Ligier JS33]].

The '''Tyrrell 011''' was a [[Formula One]] car designed by [[Maurice Philippe]] for the [[Tyrrell Racing|Tyrrell Racing Organisation]]. It made its debut in the hands of [[United States|American]] [[Eddie Cheever]] at the [[1981 German Grand Prix]] where he qualified 18th and finished the race in the points with 5th place. The car was powered by the [[Cosworth DFV]] [[V8 engine]] and initially ran on [[Avon Rubber|Avon]] tyres though the team later switched to [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear]] rubber.

The 011 raced in three seasons of Formula One ({{f1|1981}} - {{f1|1983}}) although its only full season was {{f1|1982}}. Drivers for Tyrrell in that time included Cheever, [[Michele Alboreto]], [[Brian Henton]], [[Slim Borgudd]] and [[Danny Sullivan]]. Tyrrell were able to win 2 races with the 011, both by Alboreto. The first win at the [[1982 Caesars Palace Grand Prix]] was also Alboreto's first and the last 011 victory was the [[1983 Detroit Grand Prix]]. This race was also the last of 155 Grand Prix wins for the Cosworth DFV engine which had made its F1 debut 16 years earlier in {{f1|1967}}.

The 1983 cars were green and black in colour and were sponsored by the Italian fashion brand [[Benetton Group|Benetton]].

The 011 was replaced two-thirds of the way through the 1983 season by the [[Tyrrell 012]].

The '''Tyrrell 017''' was a [[Formula One]] racing car designed by [[Maurice Philippe]] and [[Brian Lisles]]. It was built and raced by [[Tyrrell Racing]] in the {{f1|1988}} season and also for the first race of the {{f1|1989}} season. It used a customer [[Cosworth DFZ]] [[V8 engine]] as had its predecessor. The car was driven in 1988 by [[United Kingdom|British]] pair [[Jonathan Palmer]] and Formula One rookie [[Julian Bailey]]. Bailey was replaced by [[Michele Alboreto]] in 1989 as was the Cosworth DFZ replaced by the more powerful 1988 motor the [[Cosworth DFR]].

The 017 was a development of the team's successful {{f1|1987}} car, the [[Tyrrell DG016]]. Unfortunately for the team though, as successful as the DG016 was in the [[Naturally aspirated engine|naturally aspirated]] part of the championship (Tyrrell won the '[[Colin Chapman|Colin Chapman Cup]]' as the leading atmospheric constructor while Jonathan Palmer won the '[[Jim Clark|Jim Clark Cup]]' as the atmo Drivers' Champion), the 017 was equally unsuccessful. Bailey failed to score a point and also failed to qualify for 10 races. Palmer scored all of the team's 5 points with Tyrrell finishing 8th in the Constructors Championship.

For 1989 the car had minor upgrades for the first race of the season and was dubbed the '''017B'''. The car was still uncompetitive and was replaced from the second race in [[1989 San Marino Grand Prix|San Marino]] with the [[Tyrrell 018]].

The '''Lola LC89''' was a [[Formula One]] car designed by [[Lola Cars|Lola]] founder [[Eric Broadley]] for use in the [[1989 Formula One season]] by the [[Larrousse]] team. It was powered by the 3.5L [[Lamborghini V12#Formula One|Lamborghini 3512]] [[V12 engine]] designed by former [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] designer [[Mauro Forghieri]]. Drivers of the car included [[Philippe Alliot]], [[Aguri Suzuki]] and [[Michele Alboreto]].

The LC89, with its Lamborghini V12 engine, made its debut in Round 3 at the [[1989 Monaco Grand Prix]]. Unfortunately, while the aerodynamics were good and the chassis was on the pace, the Lamborghini V12 engine proved to be generally unreliable, despite its reported {{Convert|600|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}. The car and engine combination would only score 1 point in its racing life with Alliot finishing in 6th place at the [[1989 Spanish Grand Prix]]. Indeed, five time Grand Prix winner Alboreto failed to pre-qualify the car twice (Spain and [[1989 Australian Grand Prix|Australia]]) and failed to qualify once ([[1989 Japanese Grand Prix|Japan]]) in his eight drives for the team in 1989. Alboreto also suffered a broken rib driving the car when he ran over a high curb during the [[1989 Hungarian Grand Prix|Hungarian Grand Prix]].

The LC89 was updated and used for the first two races of {{f1|1990}}, being dubbed the '''LC89B'''. The car was replaced by the [[Lola LC90]] from the [[1990 San Marino Grand Prix]].

The '''Brabham BT50''' was a [[Formula One]] [[racing car]] designed by [[Gordon Murray]] for the [[Brabham]] team, owned by [[Bernie Ecclestone]], for the [[1982 Formula One season]]. The cars, powered by a [[turbo]] [[BMW M12|BMW engine]], raced for most of the year, driven by [[Nelson Piquet]] and [[Riccardo Patrese]], and won one race, the [[1982 Canadian Grand Prix|Canadian Grand Prix]]. It scored four other point scoring finishes, helping the team to finish fifth in the constructors championship.

==Background==
The possibility of BMW entering Formula One was raised as early as mid-1979. Brabham's lead driver, [[Niki Lauda]], was becoming disgruntled at the performance of the uncompetitive Brabham-Alfa BT48 and discreet discussions were held with aim of getting him into a BMW-powered McLaren. The Brabham team management were also unhappy with Alfa Romeo,<ref>Henry, 1985, p. 210</ref> not helped by the Italian company producing its own car{{#tag:ref|This was the [[Alfa Romeo 177]], driven by [[Bruno Giacomelli]] for three races during the 1979 season.<ref name=StatsF1177>{{cite web|publisher=Stats F1.com|title=Alfa Romeo 177|url=http://www.statsf1.com/en/alfa-romeo-177.aspx|accessdate=5 April 2014}}</ref>|group=Note}} and entering it into that year's [[1979 Belgian Grand Prix|Belgian Grand Prix]].<ref>Henry, 1985, p. 213</ref> 

While the proposed Lauda-McLaren deal did not eventuate and the Austrian abruptly retired at the [[1979 Canadian Grand Prix|Canadian race]],<ref>Henry, 1985, p. 217</ref> the relationship between Brabham and BMW had prospered and they came to an engine supply agreement in the summer of 1980. While Brabham switched to normally aspirated Cosworth DFVs for the 1980 season, the team's owner, [[Bernie Ecclestone]], could see that turbo engines were likely to be key to being competitive in the long term.<ref>Henry, 1985, pp. 242–243</ref>

==Design and development==
Initial testing of the BMW M12/13{{#tag:ref|This designation was derived from it being the 13th variant of the basic BMW M12 engine.<ref>Henry, 1985, p. 243</ref>|group=Note}} turbo engine, a modification of the four-cylinder iron block and existing [[Formula Two]] four-valve cylinder head,<ref name=Nye148>Nye, 1985, p. 148</ref> was carried out in late 1980/early 1981 using a modified [[Brabham BT49|BT49]] while Brabham's chief designer, [[Gordon Murray]], worked on the BT50. This was completed in mid-1981 and carried over many elements from the BT49, which Brabham had run throughout the 1980 season.  The BT50 had double wishbone suspension and pullrod activation coil spring/damper units, which were semi-inboard,<ref name=Henry244>Henry, 1985, pp. 244–245</ref> while its monocoque was an aluminium tub with carbon stiffening panels. The team continued with its Hewland/Alfa gearbox, first used in 1976 when Brabham ran a V12 Alfa Romeo, but these was found to struggle with the power and torque of the BMW turbo engine.<ref name=Nye112>Nye, 1985, p. 112</ref>  

The new car had a slightly longer wheelbase and a 48-gallon fuel cell to accommodate the fuel consumption requirements of the engine. Overall, the BT50 weighed in at 590 kilograms, ten kilograms more than its predecessor.<ref name=Henry244/> It was also one of the first Formula One cars to feature onboard [[telemetry]] as a means of monitoring the engine's fuel injection.<ref>Bamsey, 1988, p. 50</ref> 

The first public appearance of the BT50 was at the [[1981 British Grand Prix]], where the team's lead driver, [[Nelson Piquet]], used it in practice. He set a practice time 0.7&nbsp;seconds slower than his qualifying effort in the [[Cosworth DFV]]-powered BT49. The BT50 handled poorly but still recorded {{convert|192|mph|km/h}} through the speed trap, some {{convert|15|mph|km/h}} faster than the BT49.<ref>Hamilton, 1981, p. 161</ref> Piquet, a firm advocate for the BMW engine and believing, like Ecclestone, that the road to success in the near future was with a turbocharged engine tested the BT50 throughout 1981.<ref name=Henry244/> Testing was plagued with unreliability; in one testing session at the [[Circuit Paul Ricard|Paul Ricard circuit]] in France, the team suffered nine engine blowups.<ref name=Nye112/> 

Once the [[1982 Formula One season|1982 season]] began, there was relatively little development of the BT50 chassis during the season although there were some aerodynamic revisions. A total of five BT50s were built.<ref>Nye, 1985, p. 129</ref> 

==Race history==
Brabham began 1982 with three BT50s, one the original BT50 built the previous year,<ref name=Nye112/> for the season opening [[1982 South African Grand Prix|South African Grand Prix]]. It was hoped that the high altitude, as it had in the past for the Renault team, would be beneficial for the turbo engine.<ref>Henry, 1985, p. 232</ref> This proved to be the case in qualifying, Piquet second on the grid alongside [[Rene Arnoux]] in the Renault, with Patrese two places back in fourth.  However, in a disastrous race for the BT50, both drivers retired early in the race. Piquet bogged down at the start and was quickly swamped by the field. Running 13th at the end of the first lap, he spun off on lap 4.  Patrese had at least run in 4th place for a time before he too retired, due to a turbo bearing failure. Feeling the engines were still not race ready, Ecclestone opted to field Cosworth-powered BT49 chassis at the [[1982 Brazilian Grand Prix|Brazilian Grand Prix]].<ref>Henry, 1985, p. 246</ref> Piquet won that race but was later disqualified for circumventing the minimum weight limit by running "water-cooled brakes". Both drivers also raced the BT49 at the [[1982 United States Grand Prix West|Long Beach Grand Prix]], and the team boycotted the [[1982 San Marino Grand Prix|San Marino Grand Prix]] as part of the ongoing [[FISA–FOCA war]].<ref>Henry, 1985, p. 233</ref> 

BMW was increasingly exasperated by Ecclestone's reluctance to run its engine and before the [[1982 Belgian Grand Prix|Belgian Grand Prix]], issued public threats to terminate its relationship with Brabham if the BT50 was not run at the race. Consequently, Piquet and Patrese switched back to the BT50 for Belgium. Qualifying was poor, Piquet and Patrese only managing eighth and ninth on the grid respectively. In the race itself, Piquet finished three laps behind the winner, although scoring two points for fifth place, while Patrese retired.<ref name=Henry246>Henry, 1985, pp. 246–247</ref>  
[[File:Patrese at 1982 Dutch Grand Prix.jpg|thumb|right|Brabham's Riccardo Patrese only scored one points finish with the BT50]]
As the relationship between Brabham and BMW remained tense, Ecclestone was forced to compromise; Piquet persevered with the BT50 whilst Patrese raced with the Cosworth-powered BT49. At the [[1982 Monaco Grand Prix|Monaco Grand Prix]], Patrese won a somewhat chaotic event, whilst Piquet was more than two seconds slower in qualifying and retired from the race with gearbox trouble. Piquet fared even worse in [[1982 Detroit Grand Prix|Detroit]]; his main car blew its engine six laps into the first qualifying session, while the engine of the spare refused to run cleanly. As the second qualifying session was conducted in rain, none of the drivers were unable to improve their times from the previous day. This left Piquet unable to qualify for the race.<ref name=Henry246/> 

Serious consideration was given to running only a single BT50 for Piquet at the following [[1982 Canadian Grand Prix|Canadian Grand Prix]] with his spare car being a BT49 although ultimately this did not eventuate.  After an initial scare when Piquet suffered a misfire within two laps of starting the first practice session, Brabham's fortunes suddenly improved. Having qualified fourth, just over a second slower than [[Didier Pironi]]'s [[Ferrari 126C|Ferrari 126C2]] on pole, <ref name=Henry246/> Piquet moved into second place from the start and then into the lead on lap 9 and, on a day when the cool conditions suited the turbocharged engines, never relinquished it to record BMW's first Formula One victory. It was a Brabham one-two, for Patrese, still in the BT49, finished second.<ref name=Henry248>Henry, 1985, pp. 248–249</ref> 

Piquet followed this performance up with second place at the [[1982 Dutch Grand Prix|next race]], in Holland (having qualified third). Patrese, now also in the BT50, finished 15th, from 10th on the grid. The improvement in performance in Canada and Holland coincided with BMW revising the fuel mix control, a change that Piquet noted brought the behaviour of the BMW engine in line with the Cosworth DFV.<ref name=Henry248/> 

From the [[1982 British Grand Prix]], Murray implemented a radical strategy of a planned pit stop for refuelling mid-way through the race to run at the front of the field. The idea was to allow the cars to start the race with a lighter fuel load as well softer, faster, tyres which would get replaced at the refueling pitstop. Another advantage was that the drivers could run higher boost levels, knowing that they would receive a top up of fuel. Reliability proved to be a problem and this restricted Piquet and Patrese from fully utilising the potential of this strategy.<ref name=Nye112/> In Britain, Patrese out-qualified Piquet by nearly half a second and placed 2nd on the grid; Piquet was 3rd. Patrese stalled at the start of the race, allowing Piquet into the lead as [[Keke Rosberg]], on pole, had been unable to start his car in time to begin the parade lap.<ref name=Henry248/> However, Piquet retired before he could test the team's new pitstop strategy.<ref>Henry, 1985, p. 250</ref> 

In France, Brabham struggled with the fuel mixture for the engines and on a fast Paul Ricard circuit that should have advantaged the teams running turbo engines, could only manage 4th and 6th on the grid, Patrese ahead of Piquet. However, the strategy of starting with a light fuel load saw both BT50s running first and second within five laps of the start. However, having set the fastest lap of the race, Patrese retired from the lead on lap 8 with a blown engine. Piquet inherited the lead but he too retired with engine problems on lap 24.<ref name=Henry251>Henry, 1985, p. 251</ref> 
 
At BMW's home [[1982 German Grand Prix|race]] in Germany, the BT50s qualified 3rd and 5th, Piquet this time ahead of Patrese. At the start of the race, Arnoux, in his Renault, initially led but by the second lap, he had been passed by Piquet. By virtue of the team's now usual strategy of starting on soft tyres and a light fuel load saw Piquet build up a substantial lead and begin to lap the slower cars. On lap 19, with his scheduled pitstop just two laps away, he crashed into [[Eliseo Salazar]]'s ATS when attempting to pass. Both cars came to a halt and stalled, forcing their drivers to abandon them trackside. In an incident captured on live television, while remonstrating with Salazar, Piquet lashed out at him with hands and feet. Patrese had already fallen by the wayside due to an engine failure.<ref name=Henry251/>

Brabham finally had the opportunity to demonstrate their prowess at completing a midrace refueling at the [[1982 Austrian Grand Prix|Austrian Grand Prix]]. Qualifying had gone well, with the team locking out the front row of the grid. Piquet started from pole position but blistered a tyre within a few laps. This allowed Patrese, running second behind his team leader, to move into the lead. Piquet's tyre problems saw him come into for his first pitstop on lap 16.<ref name=Henry251/> Despite signalling his intent to enter the pits, the Brabham mechanics were not prepared as his scheduled pitstop was not for several more laps. Piquet was stationary for nearly a minute while the team found and fitted replacement tyres and resumed in fourth place. Patrese, still in the lead, came into the pits for his scheduled stop on lap 24. This time, the mechanics completed a swift turnaround and Patrese, having only been held up for 15 seconds, resumed the race still in the lead. It was only to last for three more laps before he spun off due to an engine failure. Nonetheless, his performance had validated the strategy of starting with a light fuel load. Piquet suffered a camshaft drive failure a few laps later which ended his race<ref name=Henry254>Henry, 1985, pp. 254–255</ref> while running in third place.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statsf1.com/en/1982/autriche/tour-par-tour.aspx|title=Austria 1982: lap by lap|publisher=Statsf1.com |date= |accessdate=6 April 2015}}</ref>
 
Both Brabhams finished in the points at the [[1982 Swiss Grand Prix|Swiss Grand Prix]] which, despite its official title, was held at the [[Dijon-Prenois|Dijon-Prenois circuit]] in France.  Here Patrese, having qualified in third, opted to run nonstop and finished in 5th. Piquet, starting from sixth on the grid, failed to benefit from running light as his car was fitted with tyres that were too hard. He was only just able to stay ahead of his teammate at the end of the race in 4th place.<ref name=Henry254>Henry, 1985, pp. 254–255</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statsf1.com/en/1982/suisse/qualification.aspx|title=Switzerland 1982: qualifications|publisher=Statsf1.com |date= |accessdate=19 April 2015}}</ref> This proved to be the last race finishes achieved by a BT50; in the [[1982 Italian Grand Prix|Italian Grand Prix]] both cars retired within a few laps of the race start with clutch problems and at the last race of the year, at Las Vegas, Piquet and Patrese fared little better.  Patrese dropped out, again with clutch problems, while Piquet's engine had issues with its spark plugs which led to his eventual retirement.<ref name=Henry254/>

Piquet scored 20 points driving the BT50, finishing 11th in the Driver's Championship. Patrese finished 10th in the championship with 21 points. However, only two points came from his efforts with the BT50; the rest were from early in the season while he drove the BT49. The team placed 5th in the Constructor's Championship with 41 points. Despite the reliability issues, Brabham gained considerable experience with turbo engines and likewise BMW gained an appreciation of the pressures of running competitively in Formula One.<ref name=Henry254/>  The shared experience was put to good use in for the following season for which Brabham fielded the BT50's successor, the [[Brabham BT52|BT52]]{{#tag:ref|Design work on a chassis with the designation of BT51 had been completed by November 1982, but it was never built due to late changes in the technical regulations for the 1983 season.<ref>Henry, 1985, pp. 255–256</ref>|group=Note}}, with which Piquet won the 1983 Driver's Championship.<ref>Nye, 1985, p. 129</ref>

The '''Ligier JS23''' was a [[Formula One]] car designed by [[Michel Beaujon]] and [[Claude Galopin]] for the [[Equipe Ligier|Ligier]] team for use in the [[1984 Formula One season]]. The car was powered by a [[Turbocharger|turbocharged]] [[Renault F1|Renault]] [[V6 engine]] and ran on [[Michelin]] tyres. Drivers of the car during 1984 were [[François Hesnault]] and [[Andrea de Cesaris]].

1984 wasn't a successful year for Ligier with de Cesaris scoring all three points Ligier earned meaning the [[France|French]] team finished 9th in the Constructors Championship. De Cesaris actually scored the three points with a 5th place at the 2nd race of the season in [[1984 South African Grand Prix|South Africa]] and a 6th place two races later in [[1984 San Marino Grand Prix|San Marino]].

The JS23 was replaced for the {{f1|1985}} season by the [[Ligier JS25]].

The '''Ligier JS25''' was a [[Formula One]] car designed by [[Michel Beaujon]] and [[Claude Galopin]] for use by the [[Equipe Ligier|Ligier]] team during the [[1985 Formula One season]]. Like its predecessor, the [[Ligier JS23|JS23]], the JS25 was powered by a [[Turbocharger|turbocharged]] [[Renault F1|Renault]] [[V6 engine]] although the car ran on [[Pirelli]] instead of [[Michelin]] tyres after the French company pulled out of Grand Prix racing at the end of {{f1|1984}}. Drivers of the car were initially their {{f1|1984}} driver [[Andrea de Cesaris]] and veteran [[Jacques Laffite]] who returned to the team after two fruitless years at [[WilliamsF1|Williams]], but after a series of crashes, de Cesaris was fired by team boss [[Guy Ligier]] and replaced by [[Philippe Streiff]].

Using the JS25, the French team were able to score 23 points in 1985 and finished 6th in the Constructors Championship. Laffite was able to score two 3rd place finishes and also a 2nd place at the season ending [[1985 Australian Grand Prix|Australian Grand Prix]] where team mate Streiff also managed to finish 3rd, although his efforts to take 2nd from Laffite almost cause both cars to not finish the race. Streiff made contact with Laffite on the penultimate lap of the race and drove the last with his left front wheel almost off the car.

Easily the most spectacular moment for the JS25 came at the [[1985 Austrian Grand Prix|Austrian Grand Prix]] when de Cesaris (aptly nicknamed "de Crasheris") destroyed his car in a high speed rollover on lap 14.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA1qAmz30mw Austrian Grand Prix - Andrea de Cesaris crash]</ref> The team had not yet seen the accident on the television monitors when de Cesaris returned to the pits and he merely told them that the car had stalled and could not restart it, causing the team to be shocked when they finally saw the crash on replay. It was after this event that team owner Guy Ligier decided he could no longer afford the repair bills for de Cesaris's frequent crashes, stating ''"I can no longer afford to employ this man"'' (this was despite the Italian's personal sponsor [[Marlboro (cigarette)|Marlboro]] paying the bulk of his salary). He was replaced by Streiff after the next race in the [[1985 Dutch Grand Prix|Netherlands]].

Ironically, Streiff was almost the cause of the team missing out on what would prove to be their best result of the season. In the final race of the season in Australia, Laffite and Streiff were headed for a safe 2nd and 3rd respectively behind race winner [[Keke Rosberg]]'s [[Williams FW10|Williams]]-[[Honda F1|Honda]]. On the penultimate lap, Streiff tried to overtake his team-mate for second place with almost disastrous results as the two cars collided. As a result Streiff's front wheel axle was severely damaged. While Laffite carried on in second, Streiff managed to limp his JS25 home and retain third place despite only have three wheels firmly attached to the car, with the front left wheel bouncing up and down over the course of the last lap, but somehow remaining attached to the car. It would remain a career best finish for Streiff. Guy Ligier, not impressed that Streiff had almost taken out both team cars at the end of the race when they were both assured of a podium finish, would not offer the Frenchman a drive for 1986 as a result.

The JS25 was replaced for the {{f1|1986}} season by the [[Ligier JS27]].

The '''Brabham BT51''' was a [[Formula One]] [[racing car]] designed and built by the [[Brabham]] team. The car, which was tested by [[Nelson Piquet]] and [[Riccardo Patrese]], was intended to race in the [[1983 Formula One season]]. However, following a change in the rules for the 1983 season eliminating ground effect technology, the team had to abandon the ground effect-BT51 and build the [[Brabham BT52|BT52]].

The '''Brabham BT56''' was a [[Formula One]] car designed by [[John Baldwin (engineer)|John Baldwin]] and [[Sergio Rinland]] and raced by the [[Brabham]] team in the [[1987 Formula One season]]. The car was powered by the [[Straight 4]] [[Turbocharger|turbocharged]] [[BMW M12|BMW]] engine and raced on [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear]] tyres. Brabham finished 8th in the 1987 Constructors Championship with 10 points scored. Both de Cesaris and Patrese scored a 3rd place driving the BT56.

After a disappointing {{f1|1986}} season with the [[Brabham BT55|BT55]], the team reverted to a more conventional design in 1987. Long time Brabham designer [[Gordon Murray]] had moved to [[McLaren]] leaving the BT56 as the first Brabham car not designed by Murray since the Ralph Bellamy designed [[Brabham BT37]] that raced in the {{f1|1972}} and {{f1|1973}} seasons.

This was the last Brabham to use a turbocharged engine. Brabham would actually not appear on the Formula One grids through the {{f1|1988}} season and would return in {{f1|1989}} with the [[Naturally aspirated engine|naturally aspirated]] [[Judd (engine)|Judd]] [[V8 engine|V8]] powered [[Brabham BT58]].

The '''Hyundai BlueOn''' is a [[Subcompact car|subcompact]] 5-door [[hatchback]] [[electric car]] produced by [[Hyundai Motor Company]]. According to the manufacturer, the Blue-on [[all-electric range]] is {{convert|140|km|mi|abbr=on}} and has a top speed of over {{convert|130|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}. Field testing with 30 units began in [[South Korea]] by late 2010 and sales in the domestic market are scheduled for late 2012.<ref name=NYT0909>{{cite news|url=http://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/09/a-plug-in-electric-for-hyundais-home-market/|title=A Plug-In Electric for Hyundai’s Home Market|author=Paul Stenquist|publisher=[[New York Times]]|date=2010-09-09|accessdate=2010-09-09}}</ref><ref name=AB0909>{{cite news|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2010/09/09/hyundai-blueon-electric-vehicle-unveiled-in-south-korea/#continued|title=Hyundai Unveils its First Electric Car 'BlueOn'|author=[[Hyundai]] Press Release|publisher=[[Autoblog.com|Autoblog]]|date=2010-09-09|accessdate=2010-09-10}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:Hyundai i10 Front-view1.JPG|thumb|The BlueOn is based on the [[Hyundai i10]].]]
According to [[Hyundai Motor Company]], the total investment to developed the BlueOn, its first [[mass production|production]] [[electric car]], was around 40 billion [[South Korean won|won]] ({{USD|34.3 million}}).<ref name=AB0909/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://detnews.com/article/20100910/AUTO01/9100346/Hyundai-rolls-out-first-electric-car--BlueOn|title=Hyundai rolls out first electric car: BlueOn|publisher=[[The Detroit News]]|date=2010-09-10|accessdate=2010-09-10}}</ref> The prototype, an electric version of [[Hyundai i10|i10]], was first unveiled at the [[Frankfurt Motor Show]] in 2009. The pre-production testing model was unveiled in [[Seoul]] in September 2010, when the first of 30 units were delivered to South Korean government agencies for field testing. The carmaker plans to build 2,500 units by the end of 2012, but sales will be limited to the South Korean   market.<ref name=NYT0909/><ref name=AB0909/>

==Main features==
The BlueOn is equipped with a 16.4 [[kWh]]  [[lithium polymer]] (Li–Poly) battery pack and charges in 6&nbsp;hours with a 220 V power outlet and in 25&nbsp;minutes to 80% with [[three-phase electric power]] (in a 380 V outlet). The maximum speed is {{convert|130|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} and 0-100 km/h is achieved in 13.1 seconds. The BlueOn has a [[all-electric range|range]] of {{convert|140|km|mi|abbr=on}} on a single charge.<ref name=AB0909/>

The BlueOn is based on the [[Hyundai i10]] and features an [[Electric vehicle warning sounds|electric  warning sound]] developed by Hyundai called the '''Virtual Engine Sound System''' ('''VESS'''). The warning system will be included in the BlueOn [[test fleet]] and it will provide synthetic audio feedback mimicking the sound of an [[internal combustion engine]] (ICE).<ref name=AB0909/>

The '''Aston Martin DBR5''' (also known as '''DBR5/250''') was a [[Formula One]] [[racing car]], designed by the sports car manufacturer [[Aston Martin]]. Following the poor results of the [[Aston Martin DBR4]] in the [[1959 Formula One season]] the lighter and smaller DBR5 was intended to be quicker than its predecessor. However following poor results in 1960, [[Aston Martin]] decided to withdraw from [[Formula One]].

==Design==
The Aston Martin DBR5 was largely based on the [[Aston Martin DBR4|DBR4]], and used the same basic chassis and engine layout. Improvements were to make the DBR5 smaller and lighter, and engine modifications meant that the power output was finally close to the figure originally claimed by the Aston Martin workshop. The DBR5 also boasted all-independent suspension.

But when that car also failed to provide competitive results against the strengthening rear mounted engined cars, [[Aston Martin]] abandoned [[Formula One]] to concentrate on their more successful sports car projects.

Two DBR5's were constructed in early 1960, but both were scrapped in 1961 following [[Aston Martin]]'s withdrawal from [[Formula One]]

The '''Lola T332''' was a race car designed and built by [[Lola Cars]] for use in [[Formula 5000]] racing and made its racing debut in 1973. The T332 was successful around the globe with race victories in places such as [[Australia]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[New Zealand]] and the [[United States]]. The Lola commonly used the 5.0 L [[Chevrolet small-block engine|Chevrolet]] [[V8 engine]], though some competitors in Australia and New Zealand used the slightly cheaper and less powerful Australian made 5.0 L [[Repco Holden]] [[Holden V8 engine|V8]].

The alloy/steel tub of the T332 followed standard Lola design practice with twin bulkheads and utilised a semi-stressed engine and transmission. Twin side radiators were mounted in front of the rear wheels which were located by upper and lower links and radius rods. Driven through a [[Hewland]] DG300 five-speed transmission, a Chevrolet powered T332 was once timed at {{Convert|305|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} at the now closed [[Ontario Motor Speedway]] in [[Ontario, California]].

Australian driver [[Warwick Brown]] used a T332 to win the [[1975 Tasman Series]] as well as the [[1975 New Zealand Grand Prix]]. In doing so he became the only Australian driver to ever win the [[Tasman Series]]. [[New Zealand]] driver [[Ken Smith (racing driver)|Ken Smith]] also used a Lola T332 to win the [[1976 New Zealand Grand Prix]]. As a side note, both the 1975 and 1976 [[New Zealand Grand Prix]]s were held at [[Pukekohe Park Raceway]].

During its competition life, the T332 also won the US Formula A/F5000 Championship in 1974 and 1975 driven by British driver [[Brian Redman]], the British Formula 5000 Championship in 1974 driven by [[Formula One]] driver [[Bob Evans (racing driver)|Bob Evans]] and the [[1979 Australian Drivers' Championship]] when driven by South Australian [[Johnnie Walker (racing driver)|Johnnie Walker]] who also won the [[1979 Australian Grand Prix]] in his T332. Walker also used a T332 to finish second in the [[1975 Australian Drivers' Championship]].

The '''Golden Submarine''' was an early twentieth century streamlined race car designed and built in 1917 by [[Fred Offenhauser]] and [[Harry A. Miller]] for [[Barney Oldfield]]. [[AutoWeek]] said that the vehicle brought Miller "nationwide prominence as a race-car builder".<ref name="AutoWeek">{{cite news|last=Kash|first=Steve|title=1917 Golden Submarine Replica|url=http://www.autoweek.com/article/20070816/FREE/70802014|accessdate=21 September 2010|newspaper=[[AutoWeek]]|date=August 16, 2007}}</ref>

==Background==
Oldfield worked with Miller, who developed and built [[carburetor]]s in Los Angeles, to create a racing machine that would not only be fast and durable, but that would also protect the driver in the event of an accident. [[Bob Burman]], one of Oldfield's top rivals and closest friends, was killed in a wreck during a race in [[Corona, California]]. Burman died from severe injuries suffered while rolling over in his open-cockpit car. Oldfield and Miller joined forces to build a race car that incorporated an enclosed roll cage inside a streamlined driver's compartment to completely enclose the driver.<ref name="VintageRaceCars">{{cite web|title=Vintage Race Cars|url=http://www.vintageracecars.com/sub.htm|publisher=Vintage Race Cars.com|accessdate=21 September 2010}}</ref><ref name="BangShift">{{cite web|title=Vintage Race Car of the Week: The Golden Submarine|url=http://www.bangshift.com/blog/Vintage-Race-Car-of-the-Week-The-Golden-Submarine.html|publisher=Bang Shift|accessdate=21 September 2010}}</ref>

==Construction==
The Golden Submarine was built from [[aluminum]] with holes for the driver to look out.<ref name="BangShift" /> The gold color was achieved with a combination of [[bronze]] dust and [[lacquer]].<ref name=VintageRaceCars />  The car cost [[U.S. Dollar|$US]] 15,000 to build.<ref name="AutoWeek" />

===Specifications===
The car featured a [[Inline-four engine|four-cylinder]] aluminum alloy engine with {{convert|289|cuin|l|sp=us}}, 3-5/8 bore × {{convert|7|in|adj=on}} stroke, {{convert|136|hp|abbr=on}} @ 2950 revolutions per minute (RPM), a [[single overhead cam]], [[desmodromic valve]]s, dual [[Inlet manifold|intake ports]] for each cylinder, dual [[spark plug]]s and [[ignition magneto|magneto]]s.<ref name=AutoWeek /> Its body and chassis were [[wind tunnel]]-tested aluminum body with rollover protection.

The '''Toyota Celica LB Turbo''' was a [[Group 5 (racing)|Group 5 Special Production]] [[racecar]] version of the 3-door liftback [[Toyota Celica#First generation / A20/35 Series (1970–1977)|first generation Toyota Celica 2000 GT]] built by [[Schnitzer Motorsport|Schnitzer]] via [[Toyota]] Deutschland to compete in Division 1 of the [[Deutsche Rennsport Meisterschaft|DRM]].

It competed in the [[Germany|German]] series in 1977 and 1978. Plagued by reliability problems, it managed to finish twice and win a non-championship race. At the end of its [[Europe]]an career, it went on to compete in [[Japan]] with minor success.

Throughout its competitive seasons, it was the only non-German car to compete in the top division of the German series.<ref name="wspr-drm1977" /><ref name="wspr-drm1978" />

==Development==
The A20 Celica was built to compete against the [[Porsche 935]]s that had dominated international [[motorsport]] and also the Division 1 of the German DRM series for Group 5 cars. It was based on the 3-door liftback [[Toyota Celica#First generation / A20/35 Series (1970–1977)|first generation Toyota Celica 2000 GT]].<ref name="racing65-1">{{cite web|url=http://www.racing65.com/greatracingcars/celica1.html |title=:::: GREAT RACING CARS :::: Toyota Celica LB Turbo Gr5 Page 1 of 2 |publisher=Racing65.com |date=1977-07-30 |accessdate=2010-09-19}}</ref>

As with all Group 5 cars, the Celica received extensive modifications to the bodywork, which was re-styled and built from lightweight [[glass-reinforced plastic|fiberglass]]. Only the hood, roof, doors and rail panel were retained from the stock model.<ref name="racing65-1"/> The Celica's distinctive features are its wider body sills in front of and behind the door panel and sloping nose beyond the bonnet, which encases the double headlamps and square grille.<ref name="racing65-1"/>

To keep up with its competitions, Schnitzer used the [[Toyota R engine#18R-G|Toyota 18R-G engine]]<ref name=TC1>[http://www.3sgte.com/page_27.htm ''Toyota Twin Cam''], p. 25</ref> from its production model with a specially designed 16 valve [[cylinder head]] and a [[Kugelfischer]] [[fuel injection]] system topped up with a KKK turbocharger.<ref name="racing65-1"/> The engine produced a total output of {{convert|560|hp|0|abbr=on}} from its [[bore (engine)|bored]] {{convert|2090|cc|cuin|1|abbr=on}} engine.<ref name="racing65-1"/>

Partway through the 1978 season, as the Celica color scheme was changed from blue to red and white, revisions were also made to its bodywork to improve its [[aerodynamics]].<ref name="racing65-2"/>

Aside being [[factory-backed|factory supported]], sponsorship was provided by optical manufacturer [[Rodenstock GmbH|Rodenstock]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://grandprixinsider.wordpress.com/2007/12/22/oh-those-germans/ |title=Oh, those Germans, part 3 – a Bavarian Jap |publisher=Grandprixinsider.wordpress.com |date=22 December 2007 |accessdate=2010-09-19}}</ref>

==1977==
The Celica made its debut in the eighth round of the DRM series in [[Hockenheimring]] in July 1977, supporting the [[1977 German Grand Prix|German Grand Prix]]. Driven by [[Harald Ertl]], the blue Celica qualified thirteenth, 25 seconds per lap slower than the pole-winning 935.<ref name="speedhunters"/> It retired from the race after four laps.<ref name="wspr-drm1977">{{cite web |url=http://www.wspr-racing.com/wspr/results/drm/drm1977.html |title=DRM Hockenheim - Division I |accessdate=27 September 2010 |publisher=wspr-racing.com}}</ref> It returned for the following round in [[Circuit Zolder|Zolder]], qualifying seventh, five seconds slower than the pole-winning 935.<ref name="speedhunters">{{cite web|url=http://speedhunters.com/archive/2009/02/19/retrospective-gt-gt-bigger-than-life-the-schnitzer-celica-turbo.aspx |title=Retrospective>>Bigger Than Life: The Schnitzer Celica |publisher=Speedhunters |date=2009-02-19 |accessdate=2010-09-19}}</ref> There it retired after 3 laps. At the final round in [[Nürburgring]], it finished fourth behind three [[privateer (motorsport)|privateer]] Porsche 935s which it had intended to compete against.<ref name="wspr-drm1977"/>

At the [[Nürburgring]] round supporting the [[Eifelrennen]] skipping the previous round also at the same track, it retired after four laps.<ref name="wspr-drm1978"/> Skipping the next round at [[AVUS]] to prepare for the [[1000 km Nürburgring]], Stommelen partnered with Ertl. Although they qualified sixth, the pair retired with water pump and engine failure. Returning for the following round at [[Mainz Finthen Airport|Mainz Finthen]], they managed to finish eighth behind seven 935s (the highest finishing non-935 in the race).<ref name="wspr-drm1978"/> At Hockenheim, after avoiding the previous two rounds, it retired after an accident on the seventh lap, and at Zolder, it retired failing to complete a single lap. It never returned to compete again with two rounds remaining.<ref name="wspr-drm1978"/>

After that season, Schnitzer exclusively campaigned BMWs with greater successes.<ref name="speedhunters"/>

==Japan==
In 1979, the Celica was brought over to [[Japan]] by [[TOM'S]] to compete in the Fuji Super Silhouette Series by its company founder, [[Nobuhide Tachi]]. In four of the five rounds held at [[Fuji Speedway]] he competed in, he managed to win on its third attempt,<ref>http://www.jaf.or.jp/CGI/msports/results/n-race/detail-result.cgi?race_id=3070&window_flg=1</ref> only to retire on all others.<ref>http://www.jaf.or.jp/CGI/msports/results/n-race/detail-result.cgi?race_id=3059&window_flg=1</ref><ref>http://www.jaf.or.jp/CGI/msports/results/n-race/detail-result.cgi?race_id=3057&window_flg=1</ref><ref>http://www.jaf.or.jp/CGI/msports/results/n-race/detail-result.cgi?race_id=3056&window_flg=1</ref>

Retired in favour of their RA40 Celica that was developed in conjunction with [[Dome (constructor)|Dome]],<ref>http://www.dome.co.jp/museum/car_m/11_celica_turbo.html</ref> the car was later sold to [[GReddy|Trust Japan]] in 1981, which then later reverted the front nose back to the original Schnitzer version configuration.<ref name="7tune">{{cite web|url=http://www.7tune.com/abandoned-in-japan-the-schnitzer-gr5-celica/ |title=Abandoned In Japan: The Schnitzer Group 5 Celica |last=Zillin |first=Adam |publisher=7Tune.com |date=2009-08-09 |accessdate=2010-09-19}}</ref> Under Kaoru Hoshino, it retired on its first round at Fuji,<ref name="jaf.or.jp">http://www.jaf.or.jp/CGI/msports/results/n-race/detail-result.cgi?race_id=3069&window_flg=1</ref> then finished ninth, six laps behind the winning Nissan Bluebird of Haruto Yanagida.<ref name="ReferenceA">http://www.jaf.or.jp/CGI/msports/results/n-race/detail-result.cgi?race_id=3087&window_flg=1</ref> Subsequently it finished third<ref>http://www.jaf.or.jp/CGI/msports/results/n-race/detail-result.cgi?race_id=3068&window_flg=1</ref> and then eighth.<ref name="jaf.or.jp"/>

In 1982, Hoshino retired in his next two races with the car after five<ref>http://www.jaf.or.jp/CGI/msports/results/n-race/detail-result.cgi?race_id=3071&window_flg=1</ref> and four laps respectively at Fuji.<ref>http://www.jaf.or.jp/CGI/msports/results/n-race/detail-result.cgi?race_id=3074&window_flg=1</ref> In its final round at [[Tsukuba Circuit]], driven by Tatsuhiko Kaneumi, it managed to finish fifth.<ref>http://www.jaf.or.jp/CGI/msports/results/n-race/detail-result.cgi?race_id=3077&window_flg=1</ref> The following year, the Schnitzer Celica was retired in favour of the newly acquired [[Porsche 956]] to compete in the newly introduced [[All Japan Sports Prototype Championship|All Japan Endurance Championship]].<ref name="7tune"/> The Celica resurfaced again for its final appearance again at the same final round at Tsukuba, managing to finish ninth.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

Since the car was sold off, prior to the collapse of the super silhouette series in 1984, very little is known of its history. Nothing was heard of the car until it was discovered in the 2000s in a [[Wreck yard|junkyard]] in Japan in a neglected state with its Trust color scheme.<ref name="7tune"/>

The ''' EMKA Aston Martin''' was a [[Group C]] [[racing car]] built by Maurice Gomm & Protoco for [[EMKA Racing]] with the aid of Michael Cane Racing and powered by an [[Aston Martin]] engine. The first chassis, EMKA C83/1 was initially introduced in 1983 and competed in the [[1983 24 Hours of Le Mans]], finishing a respectable 17th overall. A revised C84/1 also raced at the [[1985 24 Hours of Le Mans]] and finished in 11th place after briefly leading the race in the opening hours.

The EMKA Aston Martin failed to finish any of the other races it appeared at in 1985, leading to the relationship between EMKA and Aston Martin being dissolved due to financial strain, while [[Steve O'Rourke]] of EMKA Racing decided to take a break from international motorsport.

==Development==
EMKA Aston Martin was designed by [[Len Bailey]] for the founder of [[EMKA Racing]] and manager of the Pink Floyd, [[Steve O'Rourke]]. The chassis was built by Maurice Gomm and the [[Fiberglass|fibre glass]] body constructed by Protoco, with overall assistance from Michael Cane Racing. The car was powered by an [[Aston Martin]] [[Tickford]] 5,340 cc V8 engine, which was redesigned by Bailey. Featuring relocated [[alternator]], [[distributor]] and water pumps to allow for large [[Ground effect (cars)|ground effect]] tunnels to be used.

==Racing history==
===1983===
EMKA C83/1 debuted at the 1983 Silverstone 1000&nbsp;km race, with drivers of [[Tiff Needell]], Jeff Allam and Steve O'Rourke. The car failed to finish the race, retiring on the last lap due to a failed rear wheel bearing. The car next appeared at [[1983 24 Hours of Le Mans]] with drivers of Needell, O'Rourke and Nick Faure. Despite losing 2 hours due to a suspension problem, the car finished 17th overall and received the 'Motor' Trophy for being the first British car home.

===1984===
Largely due to the impending fuel regulation changes for the 1984 season, the EMKA Aston Martin did not compete that year. However, the rule change was not introduced and the EMKA C84/1 was developed for the forthcoming 1985 season.

===1985===
In 1985 EMKA along with Aston Martin introduced the new C84/1 car. The car now featured a revised rear suspension, a new bodywork and the removal of the ground effect. The C84/1 debuted at the [[1985 1000 km of Silverstone]] race with drivers of Tiff Needell, Steve O'Rourke and Bob Evans. The car qualified almost four seconds faster than the C83/1 had done in 1983, but the did not finish the race. 

The EMKA's most successful appearance was at the [[1985 24 Hours of Le Mans]]. With drivers of Needell, Nick Faure and O'Rourke the car lead the race for nine minutes during on the opening hours and finished 11th overall. Again being the first British car across the line.

The EMKA Aston Martin failed to finish both the 1985 Spa and Brands Hatch 1000&nbsp;km races, leading to the relationship between EMKA and Aston Martin being dissolved due to financial strain. While Steve O'Rourke decided to take a break from international motorsport, not returning until 1993 in the [[British GT Championship]].

The {{convert|190|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} V8 propelled the 350i to {{convert|130|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}}, while 60&nbsp;mph came up in 6.3&nbsp;seconds.

[[File:TVR 350i cp.jpg|thumb|left|TVR 350i coupé]] A modified form of the 350i's chassis, itself a stretched version of the chassis used for the old [[TVR M Series|M-series]], also underpinned the [[TVR S Series|S-series]] as well as the later [[TVR Griffith|Griffith]]. There was a short run of non-factory Sprintex supercharged 350SX (and the bigger hearted [[TVR 400SE|400SX]]) made by the Northern TVR Centre in the mid-1980s. Nine and two of the respective versions are thought to have been built. Power is not certain, but {{convert|260|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} for the 350SX is commonly cited.<ref>{{cite web | title = TVR Wedge Specials | publisher = Pistonheads.com | url = http://www.pistonheads.com/tvr/wedges/specials.htm | accessdate = 2010-12-14 }}</ref>

By 1989, after the introduction of the [[TVR 400SE|400/450SE]] and [[TVR 420 SEAC|420]]/[[TVR 450 SEAC|450 SEAC]], the lineup was rationalized and the by now least powerful 350i was dropped.<ref name="A-Z"/> Over 1,000 350i's were built. The end of the run was marked by the limited edition (25 examples only) 3.9-litre [[TVR 350SE]] of 1990-91.

'''Jaguar C-X75''' is a [[Hybrid electric vehicle|hybrid-electric]], two-seat, [[concept car]] from [[Jaguar Cars|Jaguar]] which debuted at the [[2010 Paris Motor Show]].  The C-X75 concept produces 778&nbsp;[[horsepower]] through four [[electric motor]]s, each of which drives one of the four wheels.  The batteries driving these motors are recharged using two [[diesel fuel|diesel]]-fed micro [[gas turbine]]s instead of a conventional [[four-stroke engine]].<ref name=MT092810>{{cite news|url=http://www.motortrend.com/auto_shows/paris/2010/1009_jaguar_c_x75_concept/index.html|title=First Look: Jaguar C-X75 Concept|work=[[Motor Trend]]|date=2010-09-28|accessdate=2010-10-09}}</ref> It is described as an ideas model that will influence future design and technology.<ref name=CarmagOct2010/>

In May 2011 Jaguar announced plans to build from 2013 until 2015 a limited production of the Jaguar C-X75, with a downsized, boosted petrol engine instead of the micro gas turbines in the concept model. The [[plug-in hybrid]] supercar price was estimated between {{GBP|700,000}} - {{GBP|900,000}} ({{USD|1.15}} - {{USD|1.48}} million) depending on local market and taxes.

It is powered by four {{convert|145|kW|abbr=on|0}} electric motors – one for each wheel - which produce {{convert|780|hp|abbr=on|0}} and a total torque output of {{convert|1600|Nm|abbr=on|0}}. Inherent in the drivetrain is the ability to independently drive each wheel across the full speed range, known as [[Torque Vectoring]].<ref name=NYT0929>{{cite news|url=http://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/29/paris-auto-show-jaguar-c-x75-concept-is-a-205-m-p-h-hybrid/?scp=1&sq=Jaguar%20C-X75&st=cse|title=Jaguar C-X75 Concept Is a 205-M.P.H.

The micro gas turbines from [[Bladon Jets]] generate enough electricity to extend the range of the car to {{Convert|900|km|abbr=on|0}} while producing 28&nbsp;grams of {{CO2}} per kilometre on the EU test cycle. While running solely on battery power, the C-X75 has an [[all-electric range]] of {{Convert|110|km|abbr=on|0}}.<ref name=NYT0929/><ref name=GCC0930/> Among other advantages, the micro turbines used in the C-X75 can be run on a range of fuels including [[diesel fuel|diesel]], [[biofuel]]s, [[compressed natural gas]] and [[liquid petroleum gas]].<ref name=GCC0930/> The 15kWh lithium ion battery pack weighs {{convert|185|kg}}.<ref name=CarmagOct2010/> Jaguar estimates an average carbon emission of 28 g/km on European test cycle, however, the carbon emission is around 150g/km if the turbines are running.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.insideline.com/jaguar/jaguar-c-x75-concept-first-drive.html |title=Jaguar C-X75 Concept First Drive |date=2010-12-03 |author= Steve Cropley |publisher=Edmunds InsideLine }}</ref>

Jaguar also focused on the aerodynamics in order to improve performance. For example, the carbon-fibre rear diffuser that guides airflow from under the car creating down-force, and includes an active aerofoil and is lowered automatically as speed increases. Moreover, the C-X75 features an extruded and bonded, aerospace-inspired, aluminium chassis, saving on weight and improving sustainability and performance.<ref name=GCC0930/>

==Production==
In May 2011 Jaguar unveiled plans to build a {{GBP|700,000}} ({{USD|1.15 million}}) petrol-electric [[plug-in hybrid]] supercar in the UK. The carmaker planned to build a maximum of 250 cars in partnership with [[Formula One]] team [[Williams F1]]. The decision was part of a {{GBP|5 billion}} investment plan, announced by Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) in March 2011 at the [[Geneva Motor Show]], to launch 40 "''significant new products''" over the next five years. The model was scheduled to be built from 2013 until 2015, although it had not yet been decided where production would take place.<ref name=GCC050611>{{cite web|url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2011/05/cx75-20110506.html#tp|title=Jaguar to build C-X75 hybrid supercar with Williams F1|publisher=[[Green Car Congress]]|date=2011-05-06|accessdate=2011-05-06}}</ref><ref name=BBC050611>{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-13307919|title=Jaguar to build £700,000 hybrid supercar with Williams|author=Jorn Madslien|work=[[BBC News]]|date=2011-05-06|accessdate=2011-05-06}}</ref>

The C-X75 was to be built without the micro-turbines, instead, the production version would use a downsized, highly boosted petrol engine, with one electric motor at each axle. In order to create a lightweight strong structure, the chassis was planned to be made of [[carbon-fibre]], and the engine would be mounted low for optimum weight distribution and to retain the concept’s silhouette. The C-X75 production version was expected to deliver CO2 emissions of less than 99 g/km, a sub-three second 0-60&nbsp;mph time, a top speed in excess of {{Convert|200|mph}}, and a reduced [[all-electric range]] of {{Convert|50|km|abbr=on|0}} as compared to the {{Convert|110|km|abbr=on|0}} for the concept car.<ref name=GCC050611/>

==Cancellation==
In December 2012, Jaguar's Global Brand Director announced the cancellation of production due to the [[2008–2012 global recession|ongoing global economic crisis]], as the carmaker considered that "'' it seems the wrong time to launch an £800,000 to £1 million supercar''."  The company expects to take advantage of part of the investment in the C-X75 development by using the C-X75 technology in future Jaguars. The hybrid technology could be used on a three-cylinder engine to give it the power of a six-cylinder engine, and the C-X75's sophisticated aerodynamics should also influence future Jaguars, while the high-pressure supercharger technology could be used on future performance Jaguars with four-cylinder engines. Jaguar announced its decision to continue working on five [[prototype]]s to be developed until May 2013. Up to three of these will then be sold at auction, while one will go into a future Jaguar museum, and the other will be kept by Jaguar for running demonstrations.<ref name=CX75cancel/>

The '''Toyota TF110''' was an un-raced, prototype Formula One car designed by [[Toyota Racing]] for the [[2010 Formula One season]].  The car had been designed, and two chassis produced before Toyota officially decided to pull out of Formula One at the end of the [[2009 Formula One season]]. One chassis was damaged by former team principal John Howett,<ref name="blogspot1">{{cite web|url=http://axisofoversteer.blogspot.com/2010/05/hispania-wants-toyota-tf110.html |title=Hispania Wants TF110's |publisher=Axisofoversteer.blogspot.com |date=2010-05-27 |accessdate=2010-10-04}}</ref> while the other was used for a shakedown test.  Various teams attempted to purchase the chassis.

==Shakedown==
Former Williams driver [[Kazuki Nakajima]] completed a shakedown of the TF110 at Cologne, Germany.  The car was said to feature "one of the most extreme rear diffusers seen" and also a ride height adjustment system.<ref>{{cite web|author=Keith Collantine |url=http://www.f1fanatic.co.uk/2010/05/21/unraced-toyota-tf110-with-extreme-diffuser-driven-by-kazuki-nakajima/ |title=Unraced Toyota given shakedown by Nakajima with Extreme Diffuser |publisher=F1fanatic.co.uk |date=2010-05-21 |accessdate=2010-10-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://scarbsf1.wordpress.com/2010/05/22/toyota-tf110-full-report-in-racecar-engineering-magazine/ |title=Toyota TF110 Full Report in Race-Car Magazine |publisher=Scarbsf1.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-04}}</ref>  The overall competitiveness of the car compared with other 2010 Formula One cars is unknown.

==Pirelli speculation==
When Pirelli was awarded the contract to take over the exclusive supply of tyres to Formula One from 2011 onwards, there was great speculation that the Italian manufacturer would purchase an old or unraced F1 car to allow for some testing ahead of the official F1 test window.  They had been initially linked with purchasing an old BMW Sauber chassis, but were later linked with Toyota and using this TF110 race car.  The idea was that using the Toyota would mean no team gained an unfair data advantage.<ref>[https://www.f1sa.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=22781:f1--pirelli-could-use-toyota-tf110-car-for-formula-1-tyre-testing-in-2010&catid=1:f1&Itemid=157 Pirelli could use Toyota TF110 for F1 tyre testing in 2010]</ref>  However eventually Pirelli decided to use the 2009 [[Toyota TF109]] for their testing with [[Nick Heidfeld]] at the wheel.

==Chassis purchase attempts==
Various teams attempted to purchase the Toyota TF110 chassis for use in Formula One.  The first attempt at using the car came from Serbian based outfit [[Stefan GP]].  The team, led by [[Zoran Stefanović (businessman)|Zoran Stefanović]] bought into the old Toyota F1 project for their technical knowledge.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,12433_5900119,00.html |title=Stefan GP sign Toyota deal |publisher=Skysports.com |date=2010-01-30 |accessdate=2010-10-04}}</ref>  The team had hoped to purchase the TF110s to use in the 2010 season.<ref>{{cite web|author=Keith Collantine |url=http://www.f1fanatic.co.uk/2010/01/29/stefan-gp-agree-deal-with-toyota/ |title=Stefan GP agree deal with Toyota |publisher=F1fanatic.co.uk |date=2010-01-29 |accessdate=2010-10-04}}</ref>  One of the TF110s was painted red, and fired up for the first time on February 19.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/81593&type=news&id=81593 |title=Stefan GP Fires Up F1 Car |publisher=Autosport.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-04}}</ref> The team had intended to launch and test its car on 25 February regardless of whether or not its application to the grid was successful.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/81594&type=news&id=81594 |title=Q&A with Zoran Stefanovic |publisher=Autosport.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-04}}</ref>  The test was scheduled to take place at [[Autódromo Internacional do Algarve|Portimao]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/81219&type=news&id=81219 |title=news: F1 &#124; MotoGP &#124; WRC &#124; IRL &#124; GP2 &#124; A1GP &#124; Le Mans &#124; NASCAR &#124; F3 &#124; DTM |publisher=Autosport.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-04}}</ref> with Kazuki Nakajima at the wheel.  However Stefan GP were refused entry to race in F1, and never given official F1 specification tyres by [[Bridgestone]].

[[Hispania Racing]], already in F1 considered buying the chassis following their split with car designers Dallara.  Their boss Jose Ramon Carabante made several visits to Cologne but never sealed a deal to buy.<ref name="blogspot1"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autoevolution.com/news/hispania-racing-target-toyota-s-tf110-for-2010-20899.html |title=Hispania Racing Target Toyota TF110 |publisher=Autoevolution.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-04}}</ref>  [[Durango (racing team)|Durango]] also considered purchasing the units for use in the [[2011 Formula One season]] but they were not given an entry slot for the season.<ref>[https://www.f1sa.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=22293:f1--durango-considering-toyota-tf110-car-for-2011-formula-1-fia-entry-bid&catid=1:f1&Itemid=157 Durango Considering TF110 car for 2011]</ref>

The '''Nissan Townpod''' is an electric concept car presented by the Japanese car manufacturer [[Nissan]] at the [[2010 Paris Motor Show]].

==Overview==
The Townpod was developed focusing on the versatility, so that it could adapt to different and peculiar needs.

With the Townpod concept Nissan is offering the chance of using proprietary as well as third-party sourced accessories so that customers can customize the interior specifications of their vehicle.

By doing so everyone can adapt the car to their individual needs or daily usage. For example a musician transporting its kit between gigs, a delicatessen proprietor distributing their wares or an architect carrying drawings to a client musician.

==Design==
The Townpod design features several familiar visual elements from other Nissan cars. The drivetrain featured in the concept car is the same zero-emission technology that is fitted on the [[Nissan Leaf]]. As in the [[Nissan Leaf|Leaf]], the charging points are located in the nose behind an automatically retracting cover.

The headlights on the Townpod serve as position markers when the blue "petals" are closed and headlights when open, while the external location of the pods eases basic maintenance.

Thanks to the position of the headlights, the Townpod gets a bonnet line which can recall the [[Nissan 370Z]], which ends up in a blue tinted glass house, which resembles the [[Nissan Cube]].<ref>[http://www.nissan-global.com/EN/NEWS/2010/_STORY/101001-01-e.html Townpod - News release at Nissan Global]</ref>

The '''Minardi PS05''' was a [[Formula One]] race car used by [[Minardi]] [[Cosworth]] in the [[2005 Formula One season]]. It it is the last Formula One car of Minardi. It debuted at the [[2005 San Marino Grand Prix]], and in the three races beforehand the team used the [[Minardi PS04B]]. The team earned their second double-points finish in the team's 20-year history at the controversial [[2005 United States Grand Prix]], an achievement only brought to fruition by the withdrawal of all teams using the Michelin tyres; only 6 cars participated in the race.

[[Patrick Friesacher]] was dropped from the Minardi team after the [[2005 British Grand Prix]] due to his sponsors failing to pay Minardi the amounts agreed at the start of the season. He was replaced by [[Robert Doornbos]], Albers's countrymate from the [[2005 German Grand Prix]] to the end of the season.  The PS05 was the last Formula One car developed by Minardi before the sale of the team, which from 2006 became known as the [[Red Bull Racing]] sister team, [[Scuderia Toro Rosso]].

Sponsors:
[[Cosworth]],
[[Bridgestone]],
[[LBi|Lost Boys]],
[[OzJet]],
[[CO2 Group]],
[[JVC]],
[[Muermans Group]],
[[MAN SE|MAN]],
[[SMP Bank]],
[[Upex]]

== Performance & Development ==
In comparison to its predecessors, the PS05 featured heavily sculpted sidepods, updated aerodynamics and a newer Cosworth unit, though it was older than what Red Bull was being supplied with at the time. In terms of performance, the car was regularly towards the back of the field, with occasional midfield finishes. Of the fifteen races the PS05 was used, it retired at eight races, failed to classify at one race and finished twelve races. In comparison to its immediate predecessor, the PS04B, which retired from fifteen races and finished eighteen races, the PS05 was more reliable and yet finished lower on average.
Development was slow, but stood to testament of the team's ability to design cars on a small budget. When introduced at San Marino, the PS05 featured a double plane wing on its sidepods, a first in Formula One, while in Hungary, the rear wing featured a large vertical slit, a first as well and finishing off the year was a multi- profiled front wing. The front wing was, along with [[Renault Sport F1|Renault]] and [[Jordan Grand Prix|Jordan]], a first and would be adopted by most teams by the end of the decade.

'''LMX Sirex''' (also sold as '''Sirex LMS''') was a 2-door, 2-seater [[sports car]] of Italian origin. The car was the only model produced by LMX Automobile S.R.L. (Linea Moderna Executive), a company founded by Michel Liprandi and Giovanni Mandelli.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.omniauto.it/magazine/11102/lmx-sirex|title= LMX Sirex: Un sogno in vetroresina diventato realtà|accessdate=2010-10-07 |format= |work= OmniAuto.it|language=it}}</ref> The body of the LMX Sirex was designed by [[Franco Scaglione]]. The LMX Sirex was introduced during the 1968 [[Turin Auto Show]]. However, as Liprandi and Mandelli could not afford an official stand, the car was shown outside the exhibition hall.<ref name="Encyclopedia">{{cite book |last= De La Rive Box|first= Rob|authorlink= |coauthors= |title= The Complete Encyclopedia of Sports Cars: Classic Era|year= 2001|publisher= Grange Books|location= United Kingdom|isbn= 1-84013-407-0| pages= 168–169}}</ref>

The car used a 2.3 L V6 [[Ford Taunus]] engine, although customers could also choose a different engine if they wished. Convertible and coupé bodywork were available, and the car was built on a central backbone chassis. LMX produced just fifty cars between 1968 and 1973, and another company, SAMAS, built a further twenty after LMX ceased production.<ref name="Encyclopedia"/>

The '''Aston Martin Vantage GT2''' is the most powerful racing variant of the [[Aston Martin]] V8 Vantage family. The Vantage GT2 is based on the V8 engined Aston Martin Vantage road car but is designed to run on both standard race fuel or E85 bio-ethanol.

==Development==
[[File:Drayson-Barwell Vantage GT2.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Drayson-Barwell's V8 Vantage GT2 at the car's debut, the [[2008 American Le Mans Series at Long Beach]].]]
Debuting in 2008 the GT2 is designed to meet [[FIA]] and [[Automobile Club de l'Ouest|ACO]] GT2 class regulations, the Vantage will become a customer car for use in the [[FIA GT Championship]], [[American Le Mans Series]], [[Le Mans Series]], and [[24 Hours of Le Mans]].  

The Aston Martin Vantage GT2's engine is a modified version of the standard 4.3 litre [[Aston Martin]] V8 from the road car. The larger 4.5 litre engine retains the road car’s cylinder block, heads and crankshaft, but uses competition components, including cylinder heads, con-rods, valves, camshafts and a racing exhaust system. The developed engine features a [[dry sump]] lubrication system allowing the engine to be positioned low in the chassis, for an optimised centre of gravity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.astonmartinracing.com/content/allsites/documents/GT2%20brochure%20lowres_8281e96e-6222-4a31-b1f0-b3bca0a55b50.pdf |title=Aston Martin Racing Vantage GT2 brochure | publisher=Aston Martin Racing | date = 7 October 2010 | accessdate =7 October 2010}}</ref>

The car uses the original bonded aluminium chassis supplied by Aston Martin, but uses carbon fibre panels (exc roof) and features front splitter, rear diffuser, rear wing and a flat floor.

The V8 Vantage GT2 has been tuned to be capable of running [[E85]] ethanol or normal racing fuel, dependent on the racing series.

Aston Martin Racing has confirmed the entry of two upgraded GTE-Spec Vantage GT2s in the inaugural World Endurance Championship with a works team. Both the upgraded cars will debut in tests in January. They are reported to 'wear' Gulf liveries, much like those of the GT and Prototypes of Aston Martin have before.

==Racing history==
Aston Martin V8 Vantage GT2 saw its racing debut at the [[2008 American Le Mans Series at Long Beach|2008 Grand Prix of Long Beach]], driven by [[Paul Drayson, Baron Drayson|Paul Drayson]], a former Minister of State in the United Kingdom, and [[Jonny Cocker]], 2004 [[British GT]] Champion. The car will also be run on E85 fuel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.motorsport.com/news/article.asp?ID=285329 |title=New car, same goals for Drayson-Barwell |publisher=Motorsport.com |date=14 April 2008 |accessdate=30 September 2010}}</ref>

Aston Martin Vantage GT2's have also raced in many other series including the Le Mans Series and Intercontinental Le Mans Cup. Two Vantages also raced at the [[2011 24 Hours of Le Mans]]: Jota Racing AMR and Gulf AMR Middle East. Both cars ultimately retired, one with mechanical issues and the other after losing control and spinning off the circuit, injuring the driver Mark Wainwright and damaging the car too seriously to continue.

[[File:PLM 2011 60 Aston Martin.jpg|thumb|Gulf AMR Middle East Vantage GT2 - Petit Le Mans 2011]]

==Upgrades and GTE Version==
For the 2012 season, Aston Martin Racing returned to a GT based program, after an ill-fated attempt the previous season with their LMP1 class petrol-powered contender, [[Aston Martin AMR-One|the AMR-One]]. With the Vantage GT2's specification varying slightly from the updated Le Mans GT2 (now GTE) regulations, development took place with the car relaunched as the Vantage GTE.

===Major upgrades===
Primarily, this focussed on serviceability, a major drawback on the outgoing Vantage GT2.  This included creating a new modular construction implementing a series of detachable bars in the front structure, allowing the engine to be pulled straight out of the car. This now allows the engine change process to be completed in less than an hour without any effect on suspension settings, unlike the old configuration, which could take upwards of four hours. The [[rear suspension]] and [[subframe]] have also been modified to aid serviceability. To increase safety, the [[fuel cell]] has been repositioned within the roll cage to reduce the risk of damage to its structure in an accident.

===Secondary upgrades===
Other upgrades include reductions in weight throughout, including weight reductions for many individual components such as the battery.<ref>Chris Pickering, ["Aston Bids for GT Advantage"], ''Race Tech'', April 2012</ref> 

Improvements also included a new [[Computational fluid dynamics|CFD-derived]] front-bumper, side skirt and rear wing - the latter an evolution of the Le Mans aero package which the [[Automobile Club de l'Ouest]] allowed the [[Aston Martin Racing]] team to run on the car for the entire season - "Aston Martin Vantage: The rear wing used at Le Mans in 2011 will be used during all the 2012 season with a 15 mm gurney and at Le Mans 2012 without gurney".<ref>["LM GTE Pro"], ''Endurance Committee''</ref> Modifications also improved cooling for the driver, a significant concern on the old model, which plagued Drayson-Barwell's 2008 [[American Le Mans Series|ALMS]] season.<ref>["Licence to Le Mans"], ''Greenlight TV''</ref>

The '''Buick Verano''' is a [[FF layout|front engine, front-wheel drive layout]], four-door, five passenger, [[compact car]] manufactured by [[Buick]] at the [[Orion Assembly]] plant in [[Orion Township, Michigan]].  The Verano debuted at the [[North American International Auto Show]] on January 10, 2011, during a preview of Buick's then upcoming 2012 model.{{Sfn|General Motors Company|2011}}{{Sfn|Lienert|2010}}{{Sfn|Jacquot|2011}}{{Sfn|Smith|2011}} It is the first compact marketed by [[Buick]] in the United States since the 1997 [[Buick Skylark]].

The Verano&mdash;along with the [[Buick Excelle GT]],{{Sfn|Kranz|2011}} which was developed for the Chinese market and produced in China and the European [[Opel Astra]] sedan, which was presented at the 2012 [[Moscow International Automobile Salon]]&mdash;shares [[General Motors]]' [[GM Delta II platform|Delta II]] platform with the [[Chevrolet Cruze]] and the corresponding MPV models, [[Chevrolet Orlando]] and [[Opel Zafira|Opel/Vauxhall Zafira Tourer]].

Buick is scheduled to present the next generation Verano at the 2015 Shangai Motor Show.<ref>http://www.autoblog.com/2015/04/15/buick-verano-shanghai-teaser/</ref>

''Verano'' is Spanish for summer.{{Sfn|Ulrich|2011}}

The standard powertrain is a 2.4&nbsp;L [[GM Ecotec engine#LEA|Ecotec]] [[Fuel injection#Direct injection|direct-injected]] DOHC [[Inline-four engine|I4]] mated to a six-speed [[automatic transmission]]. The 2.4&nbsp;L engine is rated {{convert|180|hp|kW}} at 6,700 rpm and {{convert|171|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque at 4,900 rpm. The engine is flex-fuel capable, meaning it can use either gasoline, or E85 ethanol, or any combination of the two fuels. EPA fuel economy estimates are {{convert|21|mpgus|l/100 km}} city and {{convert|32|mpgus|l/100 km}} highway for gasoline.<ref>http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/Find.do?action=sbs&id=32160</ref>{{Sfn|General Motors Company|2011}}  A 2012 [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6tok5np8G4 on-road mixed highway-city review] by the website MPGOMATIC showed an average 26.5 MPG on E85, and 29 for gasoline.

A 2.0 L turbocharged version became available in late 2012, for the 2013 model year, as did a 6-speed [[manual transmission]]. The 2.0 L turbo engine is rated at 250 horsepower and 260&nbsp;lb-ft of torque. GM estimated acceleration from 0-60&nbsp;mph is 6.2 seconds, matching the number posted by the [[Buick Regal]] GS.<ref name="GM">{{cite web |url=http://media.gm.com/media/us/en/gm/news.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2012/Jun/0611_verano_turbo.html |title=2013 Buick Verano Turbo Debuts with 250 Horsepower|accessdate=2012-06-13 |author=General Motors |date=2012-06-12 |publisher=GM Media Online }}</ref>

The '''Aston Martin Vantage N24''' is a race car introduced by [[Aston Martin]] in 2006, based on the V8 Vantage road car. In late 2008, Aston Martin debuted an updated version of the N24, with the newer Aston Martin Vantage GT4, which featured a larger 4.7 litre engine.
==Development==
[[File:Sebastian Vettel - 2007 Race of Champions 3.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Sebastian Vettel racing an Aston Martin Vantage N24]]
During the 2006 [[British International Motor Show|British Motor Show]] in [[London]], [[Aston Martin Racing]] revealed a near stock version of the V8 Vantage that would compete in the [[24 Hours Nürburgring|Nürburgring 24 Hours]] (''N24'') [[endurance racing (motorsport)|endurance race]].

While essentially much like the existing V8 Vantage coupé, the N24 has a front splitter and extended door sills for aerodynamic efficiency, a full [[roll cage]], a racing fuel tank, and other modifications necessary to make the car race worthy.  Other modifications include the removal of most of the interior, including all seats, replaced by a lone [[Recaro]] drivers seat and [[polycarbonate]] windows which helped reduce weight by {{convert|250|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}.

The brakes and suspension are also uprated, featuring enlarged front and rear anti-roll bars, adjustable dampers, modified subframe for increased camber and castor, cast magnesium wheels and racing brake pads. 

The engine is a modified version of the road cars engine. Including lightened and balanced internals, re-profiled cylinder heads and the engine management system tuned for race use. The engine would now produce {{convert|410|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}, {{convert|30|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} more than the standard road car.

After the car was introduced, Aston Martin confirmed that they would offer the V8 Vantage N24 to customers as a track car similar to a [[Porsche 911 GT3]] Cup.  The V8 Vantage N24 is legal for use in the [[FIA GT4 European Cup]], German [[VLN]] series, [[KONI Challenge Series|Grand-Am Cup]], and various other national series. Contrary to Porsche however, Dr. Bez announced that they would not put a premium price on the N24 and that, while it was only produced in limited numbers, cost just about as much as a regular V8 Vantage.

The Vantage N24 was on sale with prices starting at approximately £78,720 excluding local taxes and delivery. This rose to £84,500 in 2007 for the standard car and £95,000 for FIA GT4 spec.

==Racing history==
The Aston Martin V8 Vantage N24 first competed at the [[24 Hours Nürburgring|Nürburgring 24 Hours]]. Driven by Aston Martin CEO [[Ulrich Bez|Dr. Ulrich Bez]], development engineer Chris Porrit, development driver Wolfgang Schuhbauer and German journalist Horst Graf von Saurma-Jeltsch in the 24&nbsp;hour race.  The car finished 4th in class and 24th overall, before being driven home on public roads after the race. 

The N24 was featured in the British TV series [[Top Gear (current format)|Top Gear]] and driven by [[James May]] in a quest to find the best road for driving in Europe. The decision to use the "racing version" for this kind of drive was mocked by [[Richard Hammond]] and [[Jeremy Clarkson]] as the car lacked air conditioning and other comforts. May eventually had to drive naked, while pouring bottles of cold water over himself.

Additional racing success for the V8 Vantage in N24 trim included a first and second the 2007 European GT4 race at Silverstone, the first 3 places in their class at the 2008 Nurburgring 24 hours race (18th out of 220 cars entered overall), and strong showings in Bahrain (8th), VLN racing, and other tracks and events throughout the world.<ref>http://www.astonmartin.com/eng/thecars/v8vantage/v8vantagen24</ref>  The N24 was also the basis of a one-make pan-[[Asia]] series called [[Aston Martin Asia Cup]] (AMAC).

In April 2014, the team announced that their vehicles have now logged nearly 700,000 autonomous miles (1.1 million km).<ref>[http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2014/04/the-latest-chapter-for-self-driving-car.html The latest chapter for the self-driving car: mastering city street driving], googleblog</ref> In late May, Google revealed a new prototype of its driverless car, which had no steering wheel, gas pedal, or brake pedal, being 100% autonomous.<ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqSDWoAhvLU&list=PLcNF6Ihx2JoUoNKe4PxLqEcZMM0QW2yG-|title=A First Drive|date=27 May 2014|work=YouTube}}</ref>

In June 2015, the team announced that their vehicles have now driven over 1 million miles, stating that this was "the equivalent of 75 years of typical U.S. adult driving", and that in the process they had encountered 200,000 stop signs, 600,000 traffic lights, and 180 million other vehicles.<ref>https://plus.google.com/+SelfDrivingCar/posts/iMHEMH9crJb</ref> Google also announced its prototype vehicles were being road tested in Mountain View, California.<ref>Murphy, Mike.

===Traffic accidents===
{{As of|July 2015}}, Google's 23 self-driving cars have been involved in 14 minor traffic accidents on public roads,<ref name=11accidents>{{cite web|url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/googles-autonomous-car-injuries-blame-the-human/|title=Google's autonomous car injuries: Blame the human|author=Charlie Osborne}}</ref> but Google maintains that in all cases the vehicle itself was not at fault because the cars were either being manually driven or the driver of another vehicle was at fault.<ref name=theview>{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/backchannel/the-view-from-the-front-seat-of-the-google-self-driving-car-46fc9f3e6088|title=The View from the Front Seat of the Google Self-Driving Car|author=Chris Urmson|work=Medium}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Google Cars Drive Themselves, in Traffic |author=JOHN MARKOFF |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/10/science/10google.html?_r=1 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=October 9, 2010 |accessdate=August 12, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.businessinsider.com/googles-self-driving-cars-get-in-their-first-accident-2011-8 | title=Human Driver Crashes Google's Self Driving Car | date=August 5, 2008 | accessdate=May 4, 2013 | newspaper=businessinsider.com}}</ref>

In June 2015, Google founder [[Sergey Brin]] confirmed that there had been 12 accidents as of that date, eight of which involved being rear-ended at a stop sign or traffic light, two in which the vehicle was side-swiped by another driver, one of which involved another driver rolling through a stop sign, and one where a Google employee was manually driving the car.<ref>http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/google-founder-defends-accident-records-driving-cars-31508892</ref>

In July 2015, three Google employees suffered minor injuries when the self-driving car they were riding in was rear-ended by a car whose driver failed to brake at a traffic light. This was the first time that a self-driving car collision resulted in injuries.<ref>{{cite web |author=VISHAL MATHUR |url=http://www.govtech.com/transportation/Google-Autonomous-Car-Experiences-Another-Crash.html |newspaper=[[Government Technology]] |date=July 17, 2015 |accessdate=July 18, 2015}}</ref>

===Limitations===
As of August 28, 2014 the latest prototype has not been tested in heavy rain or snow due to safety concerns.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.technologyreview.com/news/530276/hidden-obstacles-for-googles-self-driving-cars/ | title=No Hands, No Feet: My Unnerving Ride In Google's Driverless Car |author= Joann Muller | date=March 13, 2013}}</ref> Because the cars rely primarily on pre-programmed route data, they do not obey temporary traffic lights and, in some situations, revert to a slower "extra cautious" mode in complex unmapped intersections. The vehicle has difficulty identifying when objects, such as trash and light debris, are harmless, causing the vehicle to veer unnecessarily. Additionally, the lidar technology cannot spot some potholes or discern when humans, such as a police officer, are signaling the car to stop.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.technologyreview.com/news/530276/hidden-obstacles-for-googles-self-driving-cars/ |title=Hidden Obstacles for Google's Self-driving Car |author =Lee Gomes | date=August 28, 2014}}</ref> Google projects having these issues fixed by 2020.<ref>{{cite web|title=Google Self-Driving Car Chief Wants Tech on the Market Within Five Years|url=http://recode.net/2015/03/17/google-self-driving-car-chief-wants-tech-on-the-market-within-five-years/|publisher=ReCode|accessdate=20 March 2015|date=17 March 2015}}</ref>

In 2012 Google founder Sergey Brin stated that Google Self-Driving car will be available for the general public in 2017,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/googles-sergey-brin-youll-ride-in-robot-cars-within-5-years/|title=Google's Sergey Brin: You'll ride in robot cars within 5 years|author=Donna Tam |work=cnet.com|date=September 25, 2012|accessdate=October 20, 2014}}</ref>
and in 2014 this schedule was updated by project director Chris Urmson to indicate a possible release from 2017 to 2020.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://recode.net/2014/05/13/googles-self-driving-car-a-smooth-test-ride-but-a-long-road-ahead/|title=Here’s What It’s Like to Go for a Ride in Google’s Robot Car|author=Liz Gannes|work=recode.net|date=May 13, 2014|accessdate=October 20, 2014}}</ref> Google has partnered with suppliers including Bosch, ZF Lenksysteme, LG, Continental, and Roush, and has contacted manufacturers including [[General Motors]], [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], [[Toyota]], [[Daimler AG|Daimler]] and [[Volkswagen]].<ref name=autonewsoems>{{cite web|url=http://www.autonews.com/article/20150114/OEM09/150119815/google-in-talks-with-oems-suppliers-to-build-self-driving-cars|title=Google in talks with OEMs, suppliers to build self-driving cars|work=Automotive News}}</ref>

An attorney for the [[California Department of Motor Vehicles]] raised concerns that "The technology is ahead of the law in many areas," citing state laws that "all presume to have a human being operating the vehicle".<ref name=NYT2010/> According to ''[[The New York Times]]'', policy makers and regulators have argued that new laws will be required if driverless vehicles are to become a reality because "the technology is now advancing so quickly that it is in danger of outstripping existing law, some of which dates back to the era of horse-drawn carriages".<ref name=NYT0511/>

Google lobbied for two bills that made Nevada the first state where autonomous vehicles can be legally operated on public roads. The first bill is an amendment to an electric vehicle bill that provides for the licensing and testing of autonomous vehicles. The second bill will provide an exemption from the ban on distracted driving to permit occupants to send text messages while sitting behind the wheel. The two bills came to a vote before the Nevada state legislature's session ended in June 2011. It has been speculated that Nevada was selected due to the Las Vegas Auto Show and the [[Consumer Electronics Show]], and the high likelihood that Google will present the first commercially viable product at either or both of these events.
Google executives, however, refused to state the precise reason they chose Nevada to be the maiden state for the autonomous car.<ref name="NYT0511">{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/11/science/11drive.html?_r=1&emc=eta1|title=Google Lobbies Nevada To Allow Self-Driving Cars|author=John Markoff|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=May 10, 2011|accessdate=May 11, 2011}}</ref>

The '''Noble M600''' is a handbuilt British [[supercar]] made by [[Noble Automotive]] in Leicestershire. It is made from [[stainless steel]] and [[carbon fibre]] and uses a twin turbocharged [[Volvo]] [[V8 engine|V8]].

==Specifications==

===Pricing===
The Noble M600 is priced at around £300,000 in the UK or about $450,000 in the United States, although a left-hand drive model costs considerably more.

===Engine and transmission===
The M600 engine uses a 4439 cc 60-degree [[Yamaha Motor Company|Yamaha]]-derived [[Volvo B8444S engine|Volvo B8444S V8 engine]] which is also used in the [[Volvo XC90]] and [[Volvo S80|S80]], but with twin [[Garrett AiResearch|Garrett]] turbochargers equipped with variable boost. This allows the user to choose from {{convert|450|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} (Road setting, 0.6 bar pressure), {{convert|550|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} (Track setting, 0.8 bar) and {{convert|650|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} (Race setting, 1.0 bar) through the use of a switch in the interior. The engine also features electronic fuel injection via a Motec M600 and Injector Dynamics ID725's. It has a compression ratio of 9.50:1. It uses an [[Saurer|Oerlikon]] [[Graziano Trasmissioni|Graziano]] transaxle six-speed manual gearbox and has the RPM redline set at 7000.

===Performance===
*0-60&nbsp;mph (0–97&nbsp;km/h): 3.0 seconds
*0-100&nbsp;mph (0–161&nbsp;km/h): 6.5 seconds
*0-200&nbsp;mph (0–322&nbsp;km/h): 29.8 seconds

*Fuel Capacity: (68 liters)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.noblecars.com/m600/m600.html|title=Flash Page Flip|work=noblecars.com}}</ref>

==Criticisms and reception==
The brakes, while servo assisted, are "barely" assisted and with no [[Anti-lock braking system|ABS]] it is very easy to lock the wheels{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}. Also, according to motoring journalist John Barker, the door mirrors get in the way if one tries to look if anything is coming. He says, "The driver’s door mirror gets in the way looking into right-hand turns."

The car was driven 3 times on the British motoring show ''[[Top Gear (2002 series)|Top Gear]]''; once by host [[Jeremy Clarkson]], who praised the car considerably and the show's racing driver [[the Stig]] took it around the Top Gear track and it did a 1:17.7 on a cold day, beating the [[Pagani Zonda|Pagani Zonda F Roadster]] and the [[Bugatti Veyron]]. A number of months later co-host [[Richard Hammond]] drove a left-hand drive version of the car through Italy and the clutch failed, causing clutch material to damage the gearbox; Noble sent the production team another car. It was also driven by Richard Hammond during a challenge where he attempted to beat a set laptime of the Stig. It has also been featured in [[Top Gear (U.S. TV series)|the American adaptation]] of the show where it receives considerable praise, the main "challenge" was to reach its top speed, the vehicle reached 215 MPH but stopped because the vehicle ran out of space on the runway it was being tested on.

The '''Lexus GS (S190)''' is the third generation of the [[Lexus GS]] line of [[mid-size]] [[sports sedan]]s and [[executive car]]s. Sold by [[Lexus]] since 2005, the line includes multiple [[V6 engine|V6]], [[V8 engine|V8]], and [[hybrid car|hybrid]] models.  A concept model for the GS line, the [[Lexus LF#LF-S|LF-S]], debuted in late 2003 at the [[Tokyo Motor Show]]. The third generation GS first appeared as a pre-production vehicle at the 2004 [[North American International Auto Show]] in [[Detroit]] with the production version being shown a year later at the 2005 show. The initial lineup featured V6 and V8 engines with rear-wheel drive, and for the first time on a Lexus sedan, the option of all-wheel drive with the V6-powered GS 300 and GS 350 models. The GS 450h performance hybrid joined the lineup in 2006.

The production GS was built on a newly designed midsize platform which would also be used on the second-generation IS.<ref>Automotive Engineering International, Volume 113, pp. 1, 28; New platform for Lexus GS, IS.</ref> Production of the third generation began on January 24, 2005 in the city of [[Tahara, Aichi]], in Japan, where all GS models would be built. The third generation GS was also the first model to feature Lexus' own [[Lexus#L-finesse|L-finesse]] styling upon its introduction.

==History of development==
[[File:Lexus LF-S LA Auto Show.jpg|thumb|The [[Lexus LF#LF-S|Lexus LF-S]] concept at the 2005 Los Angeles Auto show.]]

===Concept===
{{further2|[[Lexus LF#LF-S|Lexus LF-S]]}}

In October 2003, Lexus premiered the [[Lexus LF#LF-S|LF-S]] (Lexus Future Sedan), a concept car which presaged the design characteristics of the upcoming GS.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.automobile.com/2003-lexus-lf-s-concept.html|title=2003 Lexus LF-S Concept|publisher=Automobile.com|accessdate=2009-09-22}}</ref> The design features on the LF-S concept included a slingshot cabin, sleek profile, and fastback rear deck lid, which were translated to the production GS, while the windshield cleansing system, glass roof, and side cameras were not.

[[File:2006-2009 Lexus GS 450h (GWS191R) sedan 02.jpg|thumb|left|2006–2009 Lexus GS 450h (GWS191R; Australia)]]

===Exterior===
The third generation GS was the introductory Lexus model for the marque's new [[Lexus#L-finesse|L-finesse]] design philosophy. Characterized by swooping lines, a [[fastback]] profile, and more muscular styling, the GS indicated the future direction of the Lexus lineup. The production GS featured a slingshot cabin, first previewed on the earlier Lexus LF-S concept. The production GS also retained the quad headlamp design from the second generation model and previous [[Lexus SC]] while adding [[LED]] tailamps, and one-piece bumpers to create a more uniform appearance. The drag coefficient on the third generation GS design reached 0.27 [[coefficient of drag|''C''<sub>''d''</sub>]].<ref name=nctd/>

===Interior===
[[File:2009 Lexus GS 300 (GRS190R MY08) Sports Luxury sedan 01.jpg|thumb|Third generation GS interior (GRS190R)]]

The GS interior was available with ash leather and black [[Bird's eye maple]] [[wood grain|wood trim]], cashmere leather and brown bird's-eye maple trim, or black leather and walnut trim.<ref name=nctd/>
Major standard features included a water repellent front door glass, an acoustic windshield, solar energy absorbing glass, [[electrochromic]] auto-dimming side mirrors with puddle lamps, electrochromic [[Rear-view mirror#Automatic dimming|auto-dimming rearview mirror]], 10-way driver and front passenger power and heated seats with three-position Lexus Memory System, power tilt/telescoping steering wheel, and a power trunk closer.<ref name=nctd/> The GS sedans also were the first to feature the latest generation of Lexus' [[SmartAccess]] keyless system–-adding a [[push-button]] start for the first time as standard.<ref name=nctd/>

Other unique features included a driver-side hidden drop-down panel for infrequently used controls, a standard 7-inch touchscreen display in the center console, and LED lighting in the cabin.<ref name=nctd/> Unique to the Lexus GS series was a three-pod instrument cluster with [[machined]] aluminum facings and an electrochromic feature which adjusts for the amount of reflected sunlight to reduce glare.<ref name=nctd/> Optional features included a power moonroof, ventilated front seats with perforated leather, power rear sunshade, rain-sensing wipers, a discrete 5.1 surround sound 14-speaker 330 watt [[Mark Levinson Audio Systems|Mark Levinson]] premium sound system,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcarfans.com/2050203.006/2006-lexus-gs-sedan-debuts-mark-levinson-surround-sound-system |title=2006 Lexus GS Sedan Debuts Mark Levinson Surround Sound System |publisher=Worldcarfans |date=2005-02-03 |accessdate=2009-05-21}}</ref> XM-satellite radio and DVD-based [[automotive navigation system|navigation]] with [[backup camera]] and [[Bluetooth]] technology.<ref name=nctd/>

===Safety systems===
[[File:Lexus GS460 Facelift 20090529 front.JPG|thumb|left|GS 460 equipped with Pre-Collision radar system with grille sensor]]

The third generation Lexus GS came standard with dual front airbags, front driver and passenger [[knee airbag]]s, front and rear row [[side curtain airbag]]s, and front row [[side torso airbag]]s standard while rear row side torso airbags were optional.<ref>[http://www.lexus.com/models/GS/features/safety/srs_airbags.html Lexus GS - Features & Pricing - Safety & Security]</ref> An [[Adaptive Front-lighting System]] (AFS) was standard on the V8 model while optional on the V6 model. The radar-based [[Pre-Collision System]] (PCS) with a [[Dynamic Radar Cruise Control]] system was optional. PCS can automatically apply up to 0.3g of deceleration if the driver does not react to imminent crash warnings. [[Anti-lock braking]], [[electronic brakeforce distribution]], [[brake assist]] and [[Vehicle Stability Control]] (VSC) are standard on all models. VSC with the electric power steering system can immediately alter steering torque assist during evasive maneuvers.

[[File:Lexus GS450h 02.JPG||thumb||GS 450h interior equipped with [[Driver Monitoring System]]]]

[[Vehicle Dynamics Integrated Management]] (VDIM) is standard on the GS 430/460/450h models and coupled to VGRS it can alter steering gear ratios. VDIM became standard on the 2008 GS 350 but does not include the VGRS system.<ref>[http://www.lexus.com/models/GS/features/safety/vdim.html Lexus GS - Features & Pricing - VDIM]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcarfans.com/2050203.007/lexus-introduces-next-generation-vehicle-stability-control-system-in-new-2006-gs-430 |title=Lexus Introduces Next Generation Vehicle Stability Control System In New 2006 GS 430 |publisher=Worldcarfans |date=2005-02-03 |accessdate=2009-05-21}}</ref> The GS 450h was among the first Lexus vehicles to receive the [[Driver Monitoring System]] in certain markets. This safety system featured an [[infrared]] steering wheel mounted camera which monitors driver attentiveness, sounding an alarm if danger ahead is detected and the driver is not paying attention.

In [[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety]] (IIHS) tests the GS received the "Good" overall rating in both frontal and side impact tests. The GS also received the "Good" rating in 13 of the 14 measured categories.<ref>[http://www.iihs.org/ratings/rating.aspx?id=241 IIHS-HLDI: Lexus GS]</ref><ref>[http://www.iihs.org/ratings/rating.aspx?id=618 IIHS-HLDI: Lexus GS]</ref> However, the 2006 through 2011 model GS achieved only an "Acceptable" rating in the IIHS for rollover tests, along with the Audi A6; competitors from later years, as well as the succeeding 2013 model GS, achieved a "Good" rollover rating.<ref>http://www.iihs.org/ratings/roof/detailsbyclass.aspx?10</ref>

[[Euro NCAP]] scores for 2005 gave the GS the maximum five stars in Adult Occupant, four stars in Child Occupant, and two of four stars in the Pedestrian test categories.<ref>[http://www.euroncap.com/tests/lexus_gs_2005/216.aspx Euro NCAP - For safer cars Lexus GS]</ref> In the executive class the GS outscored all three of its German competitors in terms of adult occupant and pedestrian protection.<ref>[http://www.euroncap.com/tests/audi_a6_2004/207.aspx Euro NCAP - For safer cars ]</ref><ref>[http://www.euroncap.com/tests/bmw_5_series_2004/208.aspx Euro NCAP - For safer cars ]</ref><ref>[http://www.euroncap.com/tests/mercedes_benz_e_class_2002/130.aspx Euro NCAP - For safer cars]</ref>

==Models==

===GRS191 / UZS190 (2005)===
[[File:2006 GS 300 NYC.jpg|thumb|2005–2006 Lexus GS 430 (UZS190; U.S.)]]

In September 2005, the '''GS 350''' (GRS191) and '''GS 430''' (UZS190) went on sale in Japan; the GS 350 using a 3.5-liter ''[[Toyota GR engine#3GR|2GR-FSE]]'' engine with D4-S direct injection, while the GS 430 used the same 4.3-liter [[Toyota UZ engine|''3UZ-FE'']] [[V8 engine|V8]] used in the previous model. Sales in the United States began the following March as a 2007 model, with the initial U.S. model lineup including the '''GS 300''' (GRS190), featuring a ULEV certified 3.0-liter ''[[Toyota GR engine#3GR|3GR-FSE]]'' [[V6 engine|V6]] engine, and the GS 430. The GS 300 featured a [[Gasoline direct injection|D4 direct-injection]] fuel system for all markets except Continental Asia, excluding Singapore, becoming Toyota's first vehicle equipped with direct injection sold in the United States. The 3.0-liter engine was also found in the [[Toyota Mark X]] as well as the ''Zero'' [[Toyota Crown]], however the new GS 300 was never offered in the Japanese market. The GS 300, GS 350, and GS 430 engine options were paired to a new 6-speed automatic sequential shift gearbox.<ref name=nctd/> An [[Four wheel drive|all-wheel drive]] system was made available in the GS 300, thus becoming the first Lexus sedan to offer such a configuration;<ref name=nctd>[http://www.newcartestdrive.com/review-intro.cfm?Vehicle=2006_Lexus_GS&ReviewID=2918 2006 Lexus GS Review, Prices, Photos: New Car Test Drive]</ref> the system varied the front/rear wheel torque split anywhere from 50/50 to 30/70 depending on conditions.

[[File:2005-2008 Lexus GS 300 (GRS190R) Sports Luxury sedan 01.jpg|thumb|left|2005–2008 Lexus GS 300 (GRS190R; Australia)]]

Also new to the GS line was an [[Electric Power Steering]] (EPS) system replacing the previous model's hydraulic steering pump, while the V8 model featured a [[Variable Gear Ratio Steering]] (VGRS) system and [[Electronically Controlled Brake]] (ECB) a type of [[brake-by-wire]] system.<ref name=nctd/> In August 2005, the GS 430 was the first car by Toyota with [[Adaptive Variable Suspension]] (AVS).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.toyota-global.com/company/history_of_toyota/75years/data/automotive_business/products_technology/technology_development/electronics_parts/index.html |title=75 Years of TOYOTA {{!}} Technical Development {{!}} Electronics Parts |publisher=Toyota |year=2012 |date=2015-01-02}}</ref> AVS monitors and adjusts the shock-absorber settings at each wheel, depending on the conditions. On rough roads, for example, damping is reduced for a more comfortable ride. And, while cornering, the suspension is tightened to help reduce body lean and provide even greater responsiveness.<ref>http://www.lexus.com/pdf/cpo/IS/2014-Lexus-IS-Brochure.pdf</ref> Using the EPS system the GS can automatically compensate for crosswinds.<ref>http://autos.msn.com/research/vip/review.aspx?year=2011&make=Lexus&model=GS&cp-documentid=435297</ref>

For the 2007 model year, the GS 350 replaced the GS 300 in the U.S. and other export markets. Due to a change in [[Society of Automotive Engineers|SAE]] testing procedures, the 2007 GS 430 horsepower rating was reduced from 300 to 290 (with {{convert|319|lb·ft|N.m|abbr=on}}. of torque), while the V6-powered GS 350 was rated at 303&nbsp;hp (with {{convert|274|lb·ft|N.m|abbr=on}}. of torque). Lexus reported 0-60 times of 5.7 seconds for both vehicles.<ref>[http://www.lexus.com/models/gs/430_specifications.html Lexus.com GS specifications]</ref> For 2008, the GS 350 came with [[Vehicle Dynamics Integrated Management]] (VDIM), which was previously standard only on V8 and hybrid models. The Adaptive Variable Suspension (AVS) was now an option on the V6 model as well.

[[File:2005 Lexus GS350 01.jpg|thumb|right|2005–2008 Lexus GS 350 (GRS191; Japan)]]

In 2007, ''[[Consumer Reports]]''' predicted reliability survey blamed the 2006 first-year GS in the all-wheel-drive form, which had problems in integrity (rattles), body hardware and sound system, as the sole reason for lowering Lexus' overall score.<ref>{{cite web|last=Woodyard |first=Chris |url=http://www.usatoday.com/money/autos/2007-02-28-cr-reliability_x.htm?csp=34 |title=Luxury brands take beating in auto-reliability survey |publisher=Usatoday.Com |date=2007-03-01 |accessdate=2009-05-21}}</ref> Despite the reliability issues among 2006 GS models, the vehicle earned a "Recommended" rating from ''Consumer Reports'' for vehicle features, overall value and previously automatically assumed reliability for that year. However, the problems have apparently been solved, and the GS AWD was rated "average" in later years.

===GWS191 (2007)===
{{For|further explanation of the GS 450h drivetrain|Lexus Hybrid Drive}}
[[File:Lexus GS 450h powertrain interior cutaway.jpg|thumb|left|Cutaway model showing the GS 450h powertrain.]]

Unveiled at the 2005 [[New York International Auto Show]], the [[hybrid car|hybrid]] '''GS 450h''' (GWS191) joined the GS line in 2006 for the 2007 model year. It was the first mass-production rear-wheel drive luxury hybrid car. Its powertrain included a naturally aspirated 3.5-liter ''[[Toyota GR engine#2GR|2GR-FSE]]'' [[V6 engine|V6]] engine mated to an electric motor and a [[continuously variable transmission]]. This powertrain made use of the [[Lexus Hybrid Drive]] system of integrating electric and gasoline engine motors, giving the GS 450h a [[SULEV|Super Ultra Low Emissions Vehicle]] (SULEV) emissions rating.<ref>[http://www.edmunds.com/apps/vdpcontainers/do/vdp/articleId=109609/pageNumber=1 Edmunds review of 2007 GS 450h hybrid]</ref> In some markets, however, the car could only be purchased with at least one option package, which raises the price by several thousand dollars. The rear-mounted battery also consumed significant trunk space, which was improved in 2009 when Lexus redesigned the trunk area to increase space by forty percent,<ref name=trunk>{{cite web|url=http://autos.msn.com/research/vip/overview.aspx?year=2009&make=Lexus&model=GS%20450h|title=2009 Lexus GS 450h Detailed Pricing and Specifications |publisher=MSN Autos|accessdate=2009-03-31}}</ref> from {{convert|7.5|cuft|L|abbr=on}}<ref name=il450h>{{cite web|url=http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/Drives/FullTests/articleId=109609/pageId=69125|title=Full Test: 2007 Lexus GS 450h|publisher=Edmunds.com|accessdate=2009-03-31|last=Reed|first=Philip }}</ref> in 2007 and 2008, to {{convert|10.6|cuft|L|abbr=on}}.<ref name=trunk/> The GS 450h went on sale in Japan on March 16, 2006.

[[File:Lexus GS 450h front.JPG|thumb||2006–2009 Lexus GS 450h (GWS191; Europe)]]

The GS 450h weighed 1875&nbsp;kg (4134&nbsp;lb), but the combined hybrid powertrain produced {{convert|253|kW|hp}},<ref name=il450h/> allowing the GS to accelerate to 60&nbsp;mph (97&nbsp;km/h) in 5.2 seconds, according to manufacturer data,<ref name=il450h/> compared to the GS 460's 5.4 seconds. [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]]-rated highway fuel economy was 25 mpg (8.4 l/100&nbsp;km), while the city fuel economy was rated at 22 mpg, which is slightly unusual for hybrid vehicles of this type (as they normally have higher city fuel economy ratings).

[[File:2009-2010 Lexus GS 450h (GWS191R) sedan 01.jpg|thumb|left|2009–2011 Lexus GS 450h (GWS191R; Australia)]]

Motoring journalist [[Jeremy Clarkson]], a famous critic of hybrid vehicles and the [[Toyota Prius]] especially, admitted he loved the GS 450h. After claiming that you spent most of the time on the Prius "chewing a lot of fuel" and "making a green statement," he described "with the Lexus I drove up and down Piccadilly all day. It was great." He also felt that the GS 450h was "balanced nicely by the styling, the quality and the sense that you really are in something a little bit different." Clarkson also positively referred to the benefit of a hybrid car being exempt from the [[London congestion charge]] (for a [[£]]10 one off administration fee to register it).<ref>[http://driving.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/driving/jeremy_clarkson/article694159.ece Jeremy Clarkson Lexus GS 450h SE-L review]</ref> In 2009, the GS 450h received a new hybrid-only grille and refreshing.

[[File:Lexus GS350 1 -- 03-13-2010.jpg|thumb|MY2009 Lexus GS 350 (GRS196; U.S.)]]

A 4.6-liter '''GS 460''' (URS191) replaced the GS 430 in 2007 for the 2008 model year. Equipped with the new 4.6&nbsp;liter ''[[Toyota UR engine#1UR-FSE|1UR-FSE]]'' V8 engine generating 342&nbsp;hp (with {{convert|339|lb·ft|N.m|abbr=on}}. of torque) and an 8-speed automatic transmission. Lexus reported a 0-60 time of 5.4 seconds for the GS 460.<ref>[http://pressroom.toyota.com/presstxt/2008lexuskit/2008GS460.350_sf.pdf Lexus Official 2008 GS 460 & GS 350 Specifications and Features]</ref> Along with the hybrid GS 450h and previous GS 430 models, the V8-powered GS 460 offered the [[Active Stabilizer Suspension System]] for improved handling.

Coinciding with the introduction of the GS 460, the GS lineup received a mid-cycle styling refresh, including a revised front bumper, headlights and grille, [[Automotive lighting|turn signals]] added to the side mirrors, and new wheel options and exterior colors. Inside the vehicle, the GS received a redesigned steering wheel, revised [[Dashboard|instrument cluster]] gauges, and different trim pieces.

The '''Opel Kadett C''' is a [[small family car]] which was produced by the German [[automobile]] manufacturer [[Opel]] from 1973 to 1979. The Kadett C, which was the third generation of the [[Opel Kadett]], was released in August 1973,<ref name="Osw1">[[#Oswald Band 3|Oswald 1945 - 90 (vol 3)]], pp. 236 & 239</ref> and was Opel's version of the [[GM T platform (RWD)|General Motors' "T-Car"]]. It was the last small Opel to feature rear-wheel drive, and remained in production at Opel's [[Bochum]] plant until July 1979, by which time Opel had produced 1,701,076. Of these, 52% had been exported outside West Germany,<ref name=Osw237>[[#Oswald Band 3|Oswald 1945 - 90 (vol 3)]], p 237</ref> most of them to markets in other parts of western Europe.

==Bodies==

The body of the Kadett C was seen as being less lumpy and better proportioned than that of the Kadett B. In terms of overall dimensions, however, the two were actually very similar.<ref>[[#Oswald Band 3|Oswald 1945 - 90 (vol 3)]], p 236  "...unter Beibehaltung der bewährten Mechanik eine neue, nach damaligen Begriffen "flüssig" und elegant aussehende Karosserie, die sich zudem von Anfang an durch saubere und solide Verarbeitung auszeichnete..."</ref>

Most customers opted for the "Limousine" bodied saloon/sedan car which came with two doors. A four-door "Limousine" was produced mostly for export to markets where cars of this size with only two doors encountered customer resistance. In West Germany itself, however, the small family car market continued to be dominated and defined by Volkswagen for whom two doors in a small family car was still quite sufficient: the four door Kadett C is remembered in Germany as an "export special".<ref name=Osw237/> The Limousine body accounted for just under 63% of the Opel Kadett Cs produced. A further 11% were three door estate-bodied cars badged, following Opel tradition, as the Kadett Caravan, with the two-door coupés accounting for slightly under 10%.<ref name=Osw237/> Publicity of the time, possibly originating with [[Mercedes-Benz]], indicated that in order to minimize the risk of fire in the event of collision, the safest position for a car's fuel tank was above the rear axle between the passenger cabin and the boot/trunk, and this is where the Kadett C "Limousine" and "Coupé" had their fuel tanks fitted, accessible for replenishment via the (unexpectedly, hinged,) extractor vent on the car's right-side C-pillar. On the "Caravan" bodied estate car the fuel tank was a flatter shape, and was positioned under the rear cargo area.<ref>[[#Oswald Band 3|Oswald 1945 - 90 (vol 3)]], pp 236, 241 & 243</ref>

At the end of May 1975 the "Kadett City" was added to the range. This was a three door hatchback intended to compete on price (though not on space efficiency) with the [[Ford Fiesta#First generation (1976–1983)|Ford Fiesta]], launched in Germany in the same month.  The concept had first originated on the Kadett C's Vauxhall sister car the [[Vauxhall Chevette|Chevette]] which was launched first.  The unique panelwork for the Kadett City was in fact produced at Vauxhall's [[Vauxhall Ellesmere Port|Ellesmere Port]] plant and exported to Bochum for assembly into finished bodyshells. The Kadett City sat on the same wheelbase as the other Kadett Cs, but the rear overhang was shortened. The fuel tank was positioned under the floor of the luggage compartment at the back, as on the Caravan bodied cars, but the fuel tank on the "Kadett City" had a capacity of only 37 litres as against 43 litres for the slightly longer "Kadett Caravan". Both models featured rear seats that could be folded forward to give a long and relatively unimpeded load area. 263,090 "Kadett City" bodied cars were produced, representing more than 15% of the Kadett Cs produced by Opel, Germany.<ref name="Osw1"/>

Exhibited at the [[Geneva Motor Show]] in March 1976, and included in the range from that year<ref name=AutoMotoruSport1976/> was the '''Aero-Kadett''', an open-top Kadett with targa roll bar, detachable roof insert and a separate convertible top aft of the roll bar (like the contemporary [[Lancia Beta|Lancia Beta Spider]]). This car was built in limited numbers by [[Karosserie Baur]] in [[Stuttgart]]. Removing the removable parts of the Kadett Aero's roof was a cumbersome process and the manufacturer's recommended retail price was very much higher than that asked by Volkswagen for their [[Volkswagen Type 1|1303 Cabriolet]].<ref name=AutoMotoruSport1976>{{cite journal|title=Kurztest: Kadett Aero: Windjammer. Targa-Version von Baur auf Kadett-Basis |journal=Auto, Motor und Sport |volume=17 |pages=64–66 |date=18 August 1976}}</ref> The Kadett Aero struggled to find buyers, and was withdrawn early in 1978 by which time 1,242 had been produced.<ref name=Osw237/> Several decades later, however, the rarity of the Kadett Aero is one of the features that helps it to draw continued interest from old-timer enthusiasts.<ref name=Osw237/>

==Engines==


===Smaller Opel OHV 4-cylinder engines===


====1.2 litre (1973-1979)====

The Kadett C was launched in Germany with the 1.2 litre engine that had become an option for the Kadett B in 1971. As before in high compression (9.2 : 1 later, in 1975, reduced to 9.0 : 1)) "1.2S" form the unit returned a maximum output of {{Convert|60|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} at 5,400 rpm. However, the 1,196&nbsp;cc engine was now also available as a "1.2N" with a lower 7.8 : 1 compression ratio and in this form it produced a maximum {{Convert|52|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} of power at 5,600&nbsp;rpm. The power output of the low compression ratio unit was reduced in August 76 to {{Convert|55|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} at 5,400rpm, at the cost of a small reduction in maximum torque.<ref>[[#Oswald Band 3|Oswald 1945 - 90 (vol 3)]], pp 237, 239 & 241</ref>   

The 1.2 litre unit powered 1,389,940 of the European Kadett Cs, equivalent to almost 82% of the Kadett Cs produced by Opel in West Germany and at their daughter plant in Belgium.<ref name=Osw237/>

====1.0 litre (1974-1979)====

From March 1974 Opel added the a lower compression 1.0 litre version of the engine to the range, this featured the same 993&nbsp;cc capacity as when first seen in the Kadett A, although now the compression ratio was slightly higher (7.9 :1) than in 1962. Maximum power at {{Convert|40|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} was also the same as in 1962, though now at a slightly higher engine speed of 5400&nbsp;rpm. Performance, with a top speed at 127&nbsp;km/h (79&nbsp;mph) for the "Limousine" and 122&nbsp;km/h (76&nbsp;mph) for the "Caravan" was, by the standards of 1974, distinctly underwhelming with this power unit.<ref>[[#Oswald Band 3|Oswald 1945 - 90 (vol 3)]], pp 237, 239 & 241</ref> Quoted fuel consumption was slightly better than with the 1.2 litre cars, but in terms of overall running costs for the cars there was no corresponding reduction in running costs when choosing the 1.0 engine in preference to the 1.2N.<ref name=Osw237/> A more powerful "1.0 S" engine was also available in export markets where it suited the tax structure, with {{convert|48|PS|kW|abbr=on}} at 5600&nbsp;rpm.<ref name="AR74">{{cite journal | ref = AR74 | title = Automobil Revue '74 | editor1-last = Braunschweig | editor1-first = Robert | editor2 = et al | language = German, French | publisher = Hallwag AG | page = 419 | location = Berne, Switzerland | volume = 69 | date = March 14, 1974 |issn=0005-1314 }}</ref>

Nevertheless, following the [[1973 oil crisis|1973 Oil price shock]] car buyers in western Europe had become far more economy minded. The 1.0 engines fitted in the Kadett B had been reserved for countries in the Mediterranean with punitive car tax levels, but with the Kadett C the manufacturer made cars powered by the smaller unit available to West German domestic buyers. 254,723 Kadett Cs using the 1.0 engine were produced whereas only 10,691 of the Kadett Bs produced had incorporated this anemic motor.<ref>[[#Oswald Band 3|Oswald 1945 - 90 (vol 3)]], pp 214 & 236</ref>

====Larger Opel OHV "CIH" 4-cylinder engines====

=====1.6 litre (1977 - 1979)=====
May 1977 saw the addition of a smaller version of Opel's [[Opel Cam-in-head engine|Camshaft in Head (CIH)]] engine to the Kadett range, this time in high compression form as the "1.6S" unit. The 1584&nbsp;cc engine shared the {{convert|69.8|mm|in|abbr=on}} stroke of the larger CIH units, but the bore was reduced to {{convert|85|mm|in|abbr=on}}. Maximum power of {{Convert|75|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} was quoted, providing for a listed top speed of 160&nbsp;km/h (99&nbsp;mph) in sedan/saloon bodied cars.

=====1.9 litre (1975-1977)=====
For its first two years the Kadett C was offered with a choice between only the 1.0 litre and 1.2 litre motors, but September 1975 saw a return of the larger [[Opel Cam-in-head engine|Camshaft in Head (CIH)]] power units to the Kadett range in the form of the Kadett GT/E, inheritor of the Kadett Rallye's mantle. The GT/E's 1897&nbsp;cc engine had till 1973 featured in the earlier Kadett B range of power units, but now it incorporated [[Robert Bosch GmbH|"Bosch]] [[Jetronic#D-Jetronic (1967–1976)|D-Jetronic]]" fuel-injection. Maximum output of {{convert|105|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} at 5400&nbsp;rpm was virtually identical to that achieved by the Kadett B with its limited edition "Hoch Leistung" (high power) version of the same engine, but the earlier car had achieved its power level using old fashioned twin carburetors, a fuel feed approach now losing out to fuel injection in the face of increasingly stringent emission regulations.<ref>[[#Oswald Band 3|Oswald 1945 - 90 (vol 3)]], pp 236 & 243</ref>

=====2.0 litre (1977-1979)=====
In September 1977 the 1.9 litre engine was replaced, in the "Rallye" Kadett, with a new enlarged 1979&nbsp;cc unit. Fitted in the "Kadett Rallye 2.0E"  this engine produced {{convert|110|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} of power at 5400&nbsp;rpm, which propelled the car to a top speed of 189&nbsp;km/h (117&nbsp;mph), comfortably faster than any previous "Rallye" branded performance Kadett. The car's fuel consumption, listed at 9.5 litres per 100&nbsp;km (25/30 mpg US/UK), was also a clear improvement.

===Running gear===

====Transmission====
The car came with a four speed all-synchromesh manual transmission as standard, gear selection being performed using a centrally positioned floor-mounted lever. A five-speed manual transmission was offered as an option on top of the range GT/E Kadetts that appeared in 1975, and became a standard feature of the (now) 2-litre Kadett GT/E in 1977. On the 1.2 S and 1.6 litre engined cars it was also possible to specify the option of a "GM Strasbourg" [[Turbo-Hydramatic 180]] three-speed automatic transmission.<ref name="Osw12">[[#Oswald Band 3|Oswald 1945 - 90 (vol 3)]], pp. 239, 241 & 243</ref>

====Brakes====
At launch, Kadett Cs powered by the 1.0 litre and the lower compression version of the 1.2 litre engine were delivered fitted with {{convert|200|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} diameter drum brakes on all four wheels. It was possible to specify front disc brakes, which, following an upgrade in January 1975, became standard fittings on all Kadetts. Servo-assistance for the brakes was also initially an option which became a standard fitting - in this case from May 1975 - on these less powerful Kadetts. On cars fitted with the higher compression version of the 1.2 litre engine and on cars with larger engines, the combination of front wheel disc brakes and rear wheel drum brakes, supported by servo-assistance had come as standard equipment from 1973. The brakes on the Kadett C were operated via a twin circuit hydraulic mechanism.<ref name="Osw12"/>

===More equipment and a small facelift (1977 & 1978)===
In terms of comfort and equipment, the Kadett C was launched with two available levels of trim and equipment, either as a standard or a "Kadett L" model.   In May 1977 these were joined by the "Kadett Berlina", featuring the larger 1.6 litre "S" engine under the bonnet/hood and an enhanced package of trim and equipment on the inside. On the outside the Berlina was distinguished by a discrete chrome side strip along the length of the car redesigned headlights, now rectangular in shape and a little larger than hitherto. The larger headlights appeared to be part of a single unit also incorporating turn indicators now positioned directly adjacent to the lights at the car's front corners. The Opel "Blitz" logo was also larger, and moved from the leading edge of the bonnet into the grille. The new headlights and front indicator flashers were also included from May 1977 on the "L" models, while the standard cars retained the smaller headlamps with which the Kadett C had been launched, along, as before, with turn indicators below the front bumper.<ref name=Osw237/>

In the Autumn/Fall of 1978 the larger headlights and turn indicators were also applied to the remaining Kadett Cs.<ref name=Osw237/>

===Broadening the range for the sportingly inclined===

==== Kadett GT/E (1975-1979) ====
The Kadett C sporting "Coupé GT/E" models appeared in August 1975, a year before the rival [[Volkswagen Golf Mk1#Volkswagen Golf GTI|VW Golf GTI]]. The GT/E was priced, in 1975, at 12,950 Marks which was approximately 30% higher than the manufacturer's listed retail price (9,970 Marks) for a "1.2S" powered Kadett coupé. The fuel injected performance coupé now provided a basis for competition cars. Advertising of the time featured an aggressive two-tone yellow and white paint scheme, although it was also possible to specify a conventional "everyday" body colour.<ref>[[#Oswald Band 3|Oswald 1945 - 90 (vol 3)]], p 236</ref>

The Kadett GT/E was available, at extra cost, with a five-speed manual transmission. 1975 was the first year that five-speed transmission became available, if only, at this stage, as an option on the top-of-the-range Kadetts. In 1977 five-speed transmission became a standard feature of the Kadett GT/E.<ref>[[#Oswald Band 3|Oswald 1945 - 90 (vol 3)]], p 243</ref>

After ten years during which an apparent inability to replace the [[Volkswagen Type 1|Beetle]] appeared to threaten the very survival of the Wolfsburg empire, Volkswagen's [[Volkswagen Golf Mk1|Golf]], introduced in 1974, and although initially slow to take off in the German car market, was now rapidly evolving into a winner, and for the Kadett C a rival at least as formidable as the Beetle, in it glory days, had been. At the performance end of the small family car sector the Kadett now found itself in a crude power struggle with the [[Volkswagen Type 1#Volkswagen Golf GTI|Golf GTI]], launched in 1975 and energetically defining a new "hot-hatch" market segment. The Golf GTI was launched with {{convert|110|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} of power supported by [[Robert Bosch GmbH|"Bosch]] [[Jetronic#K-Jetronic (1967–1976)|K-Jetronic]]" fuel-injection, a new generation fuel feed system from the specialist supplier that supplied both Opel and Volkswagen. Opel's response to the success of the Golf GTI was the Kadett GT/E, powered by the 1979&nbsp;cc [[Opel Cam-in-head engine#20E|"20EH" (CIH)]] unit which had had the compression ratio raised and a resulting increase in maximum power to {{convert|115|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}}. The rear wheel suspension was enhanced through the integration of vertically mounted telescopic gas filled [[:de:Bilstein (Stoßdämpferhersteller)|Bilstein]] [[Shock absorber|shock-absorbers]] which enhanced road holding and provided a firm "sporting" quality to the ride.<ref>[[#Oswald Band 3|Oswald 1945 - 90 (vol 3)]], pp 236, 237 & 243</ref>

* Opel Kadett GT/E - Black/yellow - 8660 produced between 1975 and 1977.
* Opel Kadett GT/E 2 - Yellow/white - 2254 produced between 1977 and 1979.
* Opel Kadett Rallye 1.6S and 2.0E - Yellow/white - 8549 produced between 1978 and 1979. <ref>http://www.opelkadettc.net/en/kadett-c-technical/modells/coupe.aspx</ref>

==== Kadett Rallye (1977-1979) ====
September 1977 saw the return of the "Kadett Rallye" label for a Kadett Coupé that provided seriously superior performance to the "shopping trolley" Kadetts of the time, but was half a notch down from the GT/E in terms of price and of uncompromising performance. The Rallye was offered with a choice between the carburetted "1.6S" and the fuel injected "2.0E" engine, the larger of which at the same time became available in a high performance version of Opel's larger [[Opel Rekord Series E|Rekord E]]. Outputs are {{convert|75|and|110|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} respectively. The rear wheel suspension was enhanced through the inclusion of vertically mounted telescopic [[Shock absorber|shock-absorbers]] produced by the manufacturer's Spanish component factory.<ref>[[#Oswald Band 3|Oswald 1945 - 90 (vol 3)]], pp 237 & 243</ref>

===The "world car"===
In [[Brazil]] the Kadett C was released six months before its European release,<ref>http://bestcars.uol.com.br/classicos/chevette-1.htm</ref> as the '''[[Chevrolet Chevette#Latin America|Chevrolet Chevette]]'''. It was available with a choice of three [[petrol engine]]s, in 1.4&nbsp;L, 1.6&nbsp;L, and 1.0&nbsp;L displacements (the latter available only for the 1992/3 model year); 1.4&nbsp;L and 1.6&nbsp;L versions were also available running on [[ethanol]].

This Chevette went through several redesigns — first front and rear panels similar to the Opel version, then a look similar to the British Vauxhall Chevette, and finally a design reminiscent of the updated USA [[Chevrolet Chevette]] version. It was available in several different bodies: hatchback (1979–87), estate (called [[Chevrolet Marajó]], 1980–89), [[Pickup truck|pickup]] (Chevy 500, 1984–95) and saloon (1973–93). The Chevette sold over 1.6 million units in Brazil, being replaced there by the [[Chevrolet Corsa]].

The T-Car was also built in Japan by [[Isuzu]] and sold as the [[Isuzu Gemini]] and in Australia where it was marketed as the [[Holden Gemini]]. In [[South Korea]], [[Saehan Motor]] then [[GM Daewoo|Daewoo Motor]] built a version of the Gemini originally known as the Saehan Gemini, later becoming the '''[[Daewoo Maepsy]]''' and Maepsy-Na after a final facelift.

The Kadett C reached the United States as the '''Buick–Opel'''. This was an Isuzu Gemini; an updated version of this car was marketed in the USA as the '''Isuzu I-Mark''' in the early 1980s.

In [[Argentina]] GM manufactured a modified version with a locally developed 1.8&nbsp;L 4-cylinder OHV motor - based on the six-cylinder 194 engine - as the '''[[Opel K-180]]''' in three versions "Base", "Rally" and "LX" from 1974 until 1979. Production ended when GM Argentina closed its doors.

The T-Car also formed the basis of the British [[Vauxhall Chevette]], which had a restyled front end and launched with a [[hatchback]] body, in addition to using a 1,256&nbsp;cc OHV (over-head valve) Vauxhall engine rather than the 1,196&nbsp;cc OHV Opel engine. The Chevette made the Kadett C notable by allowing it to become Opel's first hatchback — a version named '''Kadett City''' appeared in August 1975,<ref name=AutoMotoruSport1975>{{cite journal|title=Test: Kadett City: Modeerscheinung - Neue Variante mit schraegheck |journal=Auto, Motor und Sport |volume=17 |pages=42–46 |date=16 August 1975}}</ref> based on the Chevette's hatchback body.  The Kadett's coupé body style was never manufactured as a Chevette however. Although Kadett C production ended in 1979, the Chevette was produced until January 1984. Unusually for Vauxhall models, the Chevette was imported to Germany starting in 1979 to satisfy the need for a cheaper car than the Kadett D. This import version, however was never officially badged as an Opel or a Vauxhall - being named simply as 'Chevette'. It was replaced by the Corsa A.

During its first month on the market, over 2,700 customers sign-up for the service.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://green.autoblog.com/2013/09/27/nissan-new-mobility-concept-enters-carsharing-service-in-japan/|title=Nissan New Mobility Concept enters carsharing service in Japan|author=Danny King|publisher=[[Autoblog Green]]|date=2013-09-27|accessdate=2013-11-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.houseofjapan.com/auto-moto/more-than-2700-sign-up-in-first-month-of-choimobi-yokohama-car-sharing-service-using-nissan-new-mobility-concept-ultra-compact-ev|title=More than 2,700 sign up in first month of "Choimobi Yokohama" Car Sharing Service using NISSAN New Mobility CONCEPT Ultra-Compact EV|author= |publisher=House of Japan|date=2013-11-18|accessdate=2013-11-30}}</ref> A total of 45 units were registered through the end of October 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ev-sales.blogspot.ca/2013/11/japan-october-2013.html|title=Japan October 2013|author=Jose Pontes|publisher=EV Sales|date=2013-11-30|accessdate=2013-11-30}}</ref>

===Battery===
[[File:Twizy-IMG 6981.JPG|thumb|Twizy with charging wire out.]]
The {{convert|6.1|kWh|MJ|0|abbr=on}} [[lithium-ion battery]] is located underneath the front seat. Both motor variants carry the same weight of {{convert|474|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}},<ref>[http://www.renault.co.uk/cars/model/twizy/pricesandspecs.aspx]</ref> including batteries of {{convert |100|kg|lb|0| abbr =on}}. The [[Range (vehicle)|range]] is homologated at {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}}. In real conditions, Renault announces around {{convert |80|km|mi|abbr=on}}. In worst conditions (high speed, no eco-driving), Twizy can reach {{convert|50|km|mi|abbr =on}}.

The battery can be charged with an extendable spiral cable stored beneath a flap at the front of the vehicle.
The integrated charger is compatible with roadside battery charging facilities as well as the standard 220&nbsp;V 10&nbsp;A household electrical supply. Charging an empty battery takes around three-and-a-half hours.

A planned Renault battery plant near Paris was delayed due to technical constraints. Construction will start in the second quarter of 2012 and production of batteries is expected to begin in 2014 or 2015. In the meantime Renault intends to buy batteries for its EV range from a joint venture between [[Nissan Motor]] and [[NEC]] as well as [[LG Chem]] of South Korea.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/06/15/renault-idUSLDE75E25S20110615 |title=Renault says battery plant project delayed |date=2011-06-15|first =Helen|last = Beresford|publisher=Reuters}}</ref>

Twizy is only supplied with LG Chem modules. Batteries are assembled in Renault Valladolid plant.

==Carsharing program==
Renault tested a [[carsharing]] program called Twizy Way in [[Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines]], France, beginning in late June 2012. During the testing phase the program operated with a fleet of 50 Renault Twizys distributed over a pilot area covering around {{convert|27|sqkm|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}, and around 200 were allowed to sign up for testing.<ref name=Release/> Twizy Way opened the service to the general public in December 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.automobile-propre.com/breves/twizy-way-retours-experience-boutique/ |title=Twizy Way : retours d’expérience et ouverture d’une boutique|language=French|trans_title=Twizy Way: feedback and opening a boutique|author= |publisher=Automobile Propre|date=2012-12-04|accessdate=2012-12-19}}</ref>

==Chinese copy==
In September 2014 the Chinese company Zhejiang Litong New Energy Automobile Corporation launched the Rayttle E28.

==Popular culture==
In the music video of [[David Guetta]]'s song "Rest of my Life", a Twizy was shown in one of the scenes where it is seen in a tunnel, and it also appeared in David Guetta's video for the song "[[Play Hard]]". Several Twizys are featured in Guetta's music video of the song "[[The Alphabeat (song)|The Alphabeat]]". In it Guetta himself and the video's main characters drive Twizys. The cars are then charged by electricity generated by the dancing and jumping of the people attending Guetta's gig.

The '''Lamborghini Aventador''' is a [[Mid-engine design|mid-engined]] [[sports car]] produced by the Italian manufacturer [[Lamborghini]].

Launched on 28 February 2011 at the [[Geneva Motor Show]], five months after its initial unveiling in [[Sant'Agata Bolognese]], the vehicle, internally codenamed LB834, was designed to replace the ten-year-old [[Lamborghini Murciélago|Murciélago]] as the new flagship model.<ref>{{cite web|author=di Andrea Zuanni |url=http://www.motori.it/tecnica/6998/lamborghini-tutti-i-dettagli-e-i-video-del-nuovo-v12.html |title=Lamborghini: tutti i dettagli e i video del nuovo V12 – Tecnica|publisher=Motori.it |date=17 November 2010 |accessdate=21 July 2011}}</ref><ref name=autoblogindepth>{{cite web|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2011/02/28/2012-lamborghini-aventador-lp700-4-in-depth/ |title=2012 Lamborghini Aventador LP700-4: In Depth | publisher=Autoblog | date=28 February 2011 |accessdate=1 March 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.covercars.com/cars/36185|title=2012 Lamborghini LP700-4 Aventador|publisher=CoverCars|date=25 February 2011|accessdate=25 February 2011}}</ref>

Soon after the Aventador unveiling, Lamborghini announced that it had already sold over 12 of the production vehicles, with deliveries starting in the second half of 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.insideline.com/lamborghini/aventador/lamborghini-aventador-sold-out.html |title=Lamborghini Aventador Sold Out |publisher=Insideline.com |date=9 March 2011 |accessdate=21 July 2011}}</ref>

==Background==
The Aventador was designed by Italian designer Filippo Perini.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} Similar to the earlier limited-edition [[Lamborghini Reventon]], its heavy use of sharp creases and planar surfaces are indicative of Lamborghini's contemporary styling direction which were directly inspired by the aircraft of the United States Military's Stealth Fighter Program,{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} namely the [[F-117A Nighthawk]] and the [[F-22 Raptor]].

In keeping with Lamborghini tradition, the Aventador is also named after a fighting bull. Aventador ({{IPA-es|aβentaˈðoɾ|pron}}) was a bull that fought particularly valiantly in the bull ring of [[Saragossa]], Spain in 1993.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Markus|first=Frank|title=Sant'Agata Bolognese to Zaragoza, the Heming-Way|journal=[[Motor Trend]]|date=February 2013|volume=65|issue=2|page=106|url=http://www.motortrend.com/features/travel/1202_search_of_lamborghini_aventador_death_in_the_afternoon/viewall.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Toros Notables|url=http://www.laplazareal.net/torosnotables33.htm|accessdate=6 July 2013|language=Spanish}}</ref>

[[File:Lamborghini Aventador LP700-4 LB834.jpg|thumb|Lamborghini Aventador LP700-4, Geneva]]
Production will be limited to 4,000 units (4,099 [[Lamborghini Murciélago|Murciélago]]s were built). The [[Molding (process)|molds]] used to make the [[Carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer|carbon-fibre]] [[monocoque]] are expected to last 500 units each and only 8 have been made. The base price of the Aventador is {{USD|393,695}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.autocar.co.uk/News/NewsArticle.aspx?AR=255814 |title=Lambo set for 4000 Aventadors |author=|date=10 March 2011 |work= |publisher=autocar.co.uk |accessdate=31 March 2011}}</ref>

The car's shape also borrows heavily from Lamborghini's limited-edition [[Lamborghini Reventón|Reventón]] and their [[Lamborghini Estoque|Estoque]] concept car.

The vehicle was unveiled at [[Lummus Park, Miami Beach|Lummus Park]], Miami, followed by [[Miami International Airport]],<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://www.lamborghini.com/en/company/news/details/1/1/1/miami-calling/?cHash=bc150d2e56df01d2aea00dcb37a7320c |title=Miami Calling |publisher=Lamborghini |date=25 January 2013 |accessdate=13 December 2013}}</ref> followed by Auto China 2014 (with Nazionale configuration via Lamborghini Ad Personam personalization program).<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2014/04/20/lamborghini-aventador-nazionale-beijing-official/ |title= Lamborghini reveals Aventador Nazionale in Beijing |publisher=autoblog |date=20 April 2014 |accessdate=13 December 2013}}</ref>

==Aventador LP 700-4 Roadster==
The 2013 Aventador LP 700-4 Roadster was announced for production on 27 December 2012, equipped with the same V12 engine as the coupé version, Lamborghini claims again that it can reach {{convert|100|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} in 2.9 seconds and a top speed equaling that of the coupe, at {{convert|349|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite web|last=Sanchez|first=Edward A.|title=First Look:2013 Lamborghini Aventador LP 700-4 Roadster|url= http://www.motortrend.com/roadtests/exotic/1211_2013_lamborghini_aventador_lp_700_4_roadster_first_look/|publisher=Motor Trend|accessdate=25 December 2012}}</ref>

The removable roof consists of two [[carbon fiber]] panels, weighing {{convert|6|kg|lbs|abbr=on}} each, which required the reinforcement of the rear pillar to compensate for the loss of structural integrity as well as to accommodate the rollover protection and ventilations systems for the engine. The panels are of easy removal and are stored in the front luggage compartment. The Aventador Roadster has a unique engine cover design and an attachable wind deflector to improve cabin airflow at high speed as well as a gloss black finish in the A-pillars, windshield header, roof panels, and rear window area. The car has a {{USD|441,600}} base price. With a total weight of {{convert|1625|kg|lb|abbr=on}} it's only {{convert|50|kg|lb|abbr=on}} heavier than the coupé (the weight of the roof, plus additional stiffening in the sills and A-pillars).<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/car-manufacturers/lamborghini/9870441/Lamborghini-Aventador-LP-700-4-Roadster-review.html |title=Lamborghini Aventador LP 700-4 Roadster review |first=Paul |last=Hudson |work=Telegraph |location=UK |date=14 February 2013 |accessdate=20 October 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2012/11/15/lamborghini-aventador-lp-700-4-roadster-priced-from-441-600-for/ |title=Lamborghini Aventador LP 700-4 Roadster priced from $441,600 for US |first=Jeffrey N. |last=Ross |work=Autoblog |date=15 November 2012 |accessdate=20 October 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324662404578330253825246818.html |title=2013 Lamborghini Aventador Roadster Review: For the Tall Driver in a Huge Hurry |first=Dan |last=Neil |work=WSJ.com |date=4 April 2013 |accessdate=20 October 2013}}</ref>

Six months after unveiling the Aventador, plans for a roadster version were leaked by the U.S. [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] after it included the model on a data sheet on its website. Lamborghini officially unveiled the Aventador J to the world at the 2012 [[Geneva Motor Show]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.caradvice.com.au/161871/lamborghini-aventador-j-unveiled |title=Lamborghini Aventador J unveiled |publisher=Caradvice.com.au |year=2012 |accessdate=6 March 2012}}</ref> The roofless and windowless concept car uses the same V12 engine as the standard Aventador, producing 700&nbsp;hp through a lightweight seven-speed automated transmission.

==Reception==
[[File:Lamborghini Aventador LP 700-4 chassis - Flickr - J.Smith831.jpg|thumb|Unibody construction as used for the Aventador LP700-4]]
Automotive magazines such as ''Car and Driver'' and ''Motor Trend'' reviewed the Aventador. ''Car and Driver'' titled their article "The best Lamborghini ever." ''Motor Trend'' described it as "the friendliest V-12 supercar in the world." Praise for Lamborghini's all-new V-12 powerplant centered on the engine's responsiveness, torque, and smooth power output. Criticism centered mainly around the Aventador's unrefined single-disc clutch.<ref>{{cite journal|first=Aaron |last=Robinson |url=http://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/2012-lamborghini-aventador-lp700-4-road-test-review-the-best-lamborghini-ever-page-2 |title=The Best Lamborghini Ever |publisher=Car and Driver |date=December 2011 |accessdate=16 February 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Lago |first=Carlos |url=http://www.motortrend.com/roadtests/exotic/1201_2012_lamborghini_aventador_lp_700_4_test/ |title=2012 Lamborghini Aventador LP 700-4 European Spec First Test |publisher=Motor Trend |date=30 January 2012 |accessdate=16 February 2013}}</ref>

On 31 July 2011, the Aventador was reviewed by the motorsport show ''[[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]]''. Host [[Richard Hammond]] was impressed with the performance and handling of the car. His biggest complaint was a nostalgic poke at the Aventador's accessible temperament, implying that it left him longing for the "danger" associated with driving previous Lamborghini supercars.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Top Gear |series=Series 17|serieslink=Top Gear (series 17)|number=6|airdate=31 July 2011|network=BBC 2}}</ref> The Aventador posted the fifth<!--please see the talk page discussion before changing this to first--> fastest time ever recorded on the [[Top Gear test track]] with a time of 1:16.5, beating the {{USD|2,000,000}} [[Bugatti Veyron Super Sport]], the [[Enzo Ferrari (automobile)|Ferrari Enzo]], the [[Porsche 911 GT3]], and other supercars from around the world. In season 18 of the program, cohost Jeremy Clarkson said that the Aventador is better than the [[Ferrari 458 Italia]] (which they had previously called the best super car ever), describing it as being "£200,000 worth of dreams."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/topgear/show/powerlaps.shtml |title=Power Laps |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=16 February 2013}}</ref> The Aventador won the "Supercar of the Year 2011" from [[Top Gear (magazine)|Top Gear]].
