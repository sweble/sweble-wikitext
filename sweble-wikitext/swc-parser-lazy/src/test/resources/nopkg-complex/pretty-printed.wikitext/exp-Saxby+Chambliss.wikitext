'''Clarence Saxby Chambliss''' (born November 10, 1943) is the senior [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] from [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. He is a member of the [[U.S. Republican Party|Republican Party]]. In the 110th Congress, Chambliss serves as the ranking Republican member of the [[United States Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry]], chairing the committee during the 109th Congress (2005-2007).

==Early life, education, and family==

Chambliss, the son of an [[Episcopalian]] minister,<ref name="BRC">"R. Saxby Chambliss." Biography Resource Center Online. Gale Group, 2002. Reproduced in Biography Resource Center. Farmington Hills, Mich.: Gale, 2009.</ref> was born in [[Warrenton, North Carolina]]. He graduated from [[C.E. Byrd High School]] in [[Shreveport]], [[Louisiana]], in 1961. He attended [[Louisiana Tech University]] from 1961-1962 and earned a [[bachelor's degree]] in Business Administration from the [[University of Georgia]] in 1966, working his way through college at a bakery in [[Athens, Georgia|Athens]].<ref name="BRC"/>  He received his [[Juris Doctor]] from the [[University of Tennessee]] College of Law in 1968. He is a member of the [[Sigma Chi]] Fraternity.

During the [[Vietnam War]], Chambliss received five student deferments and was also given a medical deferment (1-Y) for bad knees due to a [[football]] injury.<ref>Tom Robbins, [http://www.villagevoice.com/news/0434,robbins,56166,1.html "The Sunshine Patriots"], ''[[Village Voice]]'', August 17, 2004</ref>

	 

Chambliss is a member of [[St. John's Episcopal Church (Moultrie, Georgia)|St. John's Episcopal Church]] in [[Moultrie, Georgia]]. He married Julianne Frohbert in 1966 and they have two children and two grandchildren.

Chambliss's son Bo is a registered lobbyist for the [[Chicago Mercantile Exchange]] and lobbies on commodity futures trading issues that fall under legislative jurisdiction of the [[United States Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry|Senate Agriculture Committee]], of which the Senator is a member. The Senator's office enacted a policy that prevents Bo from lobbying the Senator or his staff.<ref>[http://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/060307/7congress.htm?track=rss ''Democrats target Georgia's Chambliss over son's lobbying'' — USNews.com 3/7/06]</ref>

==House of Representatives, 1995-2003==

Chambliss was elected to the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] in 1994 as one of the new [[Conservatism|conservative]] Republican congressmen whose elections caused the party to gain a majority in both houses of Congress. A long-time Congressman and fellow Georgian, [[Newt Gingrich]], was the leader of the movement, and Chambliss and the other Republicans elected that year are known as the [[Republican Revolution|Class of '94]].

Chambliss was elected from the [[Macon, Georgia|Macon]]-based 8th District, after six-term incumbent [[J. Roy Rowland]] retired. He was elected with 63% of the vote—an unexpectedly large margin since the 8th had never elected a Republican. He faced a tough re-election fight in 1996 against Macon attorney Jim Wiggins, but breezed to reelection in 1998 and 2000.

During his four terms in the House, Chambliss served on the [[United States House of Representatives Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence]] and chaired the House Intelligence Subcommittee on Terrorism and Homeland Security.

Less than a month after the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks]], the House Intelligence Subcommittee on Terrorism and Homeland Security, which Chambliss chaired, investigated intelligence issues related to the attacks. The committee's investigation resulted in the first comprehensive report detailing critical shortfalls within the United States intelligence community's performance and technological capabilities.<ref>[http://archives.cnn.com/2001/COMMUNITY/10/02/chambliss/ Rep. Saxby Chambliss: Anti-terrorism measures in the U.S.], ''[[CNN.com]]'', October 2, 2001</ref>

Chambliss was criticized for remarks he made during a November 19, 2001 meeting with first responders in [[Valdosta, Georgia]], where he said that homeland security would be improved by turning the sheriff loose to "arrest every [[Muslim]] that crosses the state line." Chambliss apologized for the remarks.<ref>Melanie Eversley, "Chambliss apologizes for remark on Muslims", ''[[Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]'', November 21, 2001.</ref>

In 2006, Chambliss was among several congressional Republicans and Democrats who returned campaign donations from [[Jack Abramoff]].<ref>[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/10723902/ Bush, lawmakers returning Abramoff donations], ''[[MSNBC]]'', January 5, 2006</ref>

===Elections===

====2002 race====

<div class="rellink<nowiki> </nowiki>relarticle mainarticle">Main article: [[United States Senate election in Georgia, 2002|United States Senate election in Georgia, 2002]]</div>
Chambliss ran for the Senate in 2002, facing freshman [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic]] incumbent [[Max Cleland]].  Chambliss's political career would have likely ended if he hadn't run for the Senate; the state legislature had shifted his home in Moultrie (along with most of the southern portion of his district) to the nearby [[Georgia's 1st congressional district|1st district]], represented by fellow Republican [[Jack Kingston]].

Chambliss focused on the issue of [[national defense]] and [[homeland security]] during his campaign, and released an ad that included [[Osama bin Laden]] and [[Saddam Hussein]], highlighting Cleland's record on the issues of war and terrorism.<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKFYpd0q9nE Chambliss Ad (Cleland)], ''You Tube'', August 02, 2006</ref>

Chambliss received criticism from Democrats and Republicans for this ad, pointing out that he, who hadn't served in the Vietnam War due to receiving military deferments, had attacked a Vietnam War veteran who lost three limbs during his service for not being tough enough on issues of war and homeland security. Republican Senator [[John McCain]] of [[Arizona]] said of one ad, "[I]t's worse than disgraceful, it's reprehensible;" Senator [[Chuck Hagel]] of [[Nebraska]] said the ads were "beyond offensive to me."<ref>[http://mediamatters.org/items/200407300007 ''Carlson attempted to downplay Republican attacks on Cleland'' — Media Matters, July 30, 2004]</ref> On the other hand, Chambliss supporters say the ad did not question Cleland's patriotism, but rather his judgment.<ref>{{citenews|first=Michael|last=Crowley|authorlink=|author=|coauthors=|title=Former Sen. Max Cleland: How the disabled war veteran became the Democrats' mascot|url=http://slate.msn.com/id/2098171|date=April 2, 2004|accessdate=2009-01-23}}</ref>

Chambliss won the election, receiving 53 percent of the votes to Cleland's 46 percent.

Since no candidate exceeded 50% of the vote, a runoff election between Chambliss and Martin was held on December 2, 2008.

====Imperial Sugar====

During the run-off period, Chambliss received a subpoena regarding the investigation of a lawsuit against [[Imperial Sugar]] that claims that Imperial "wrongfully" failed to remove hazards that caused the disaster of a [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]]-based sugar refinery that exploded on Feb. 7, 2008. Chambliss was accused of "harassing"<ref>{{cite news | last = Peterson | first = Larry | title = Chambliss in sugar furor | publisher = Savannah morning news| date = 2008-07-31| url = http://savannahnow.com/node/542481 | accessdate = 2008-11-25}}</ref> a former sugar company executive. In a statement, Chambliss said he has referred the matter to Senate lawyers. Chambliss has stated: "I continue to sympathize with the families who were devastated by this tragedy and I will continue to work to protect the interests of those families." Savannah attorney Mark Tate, "an active backer of Democratic candidates," insisted that "there is nothing political" about the timing of the subpoena. When Tate subpoenaed Chambliss to testify in the case, Chambliss claimed "legislative immunity."<ref>{{cite news | last = Peterson | first = Larry | title = Chambliss subpoenaed in Imperial Sugar case | publisher = Savannah morning news| date = 2008-10-24| url = http://savannahnow.com/node/601053 | accessdate = 2008-11-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | last = Peterson | first = Larry | title = Chambliss says he doesn't have to obey order to testify in Imperial Sugar lawsuit | publisher = Savannah morning news| date = 2008-11-16| url = http://savannahnow.com/node/618254 | accessdate = 2008-11-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | last = ATKINS | first = MICHAEL| title = Imperial Sugar executive defends Chambliss | publisher = Savannah morning news| date = 2008-11-20| url = http://savannahnow.com/node/620312 | accessdate = 2008-11-25 }}</ref>
