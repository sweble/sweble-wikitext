A region named [[Germania]], inhabited by several [[Germanic people]]s, was [[Germania (book)|documented]] before AD&nbsp;100. Beginning in the 10th century, German territories formed a central part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], which lasted until 1806. During the 16th century, northern German regions became the centre of the [[Protestant Reformation]] while southern and western parts remained dominated by [[Roman Catholic]] denominations. As a modern [[nation-state]], the country was first [[Unification of Germany|unified]] in 1871, with the inception of the [[German Empire]]. After the proclamation of the [[Weimar Republic]] in 1918 the [[Third Reich]] followed in 1933. The period was marked by a dictatorship and the initiation of [[World War II]]. After 1945, Germany was divided by [[Allied Occupation Zones in Germany|allied occupation]], and evolved into two states, [[East Germany]] and [[West Germany]]. In 1990 Germany was [[German reunification|reunified]]. West Germany was a founding member of the [[European Communities|European Community]] in 1957, which became the EU in 1993.

===Etymology===
{{Main|Names of Germany|List of country name etymologies}}

The English word "Germany" derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] <ref>{{cite book|last = Stümpel|first = Gustav|title = Name und Nationalität der Germanen. Eine neue Untersuchung zu Poseidonios, Caesar und Tacitus|origyear = 1932|publisher = Dieterich|location = Leipzig|language = German|pages = 60}}</ref> term [[Germania]]. The name "Germania" came into use after [[Julius Caesar]] adopted it from a [[Gaulish language|Gallic]] term for the peoples east of the [[Rhine]] that could possibly have meant "neighbour", or "men of forests", or even "men with spears".<ref>{{cite book |last= Schulze |first=Hagen |authorlink=Hagen Schulze |title=Germany: A New History |publisher= [[Harvard University Press]]|page=4 |year=1998 |isbn= 0-674-80688-3}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&entry=t27.e6407 | section = German | title = The Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Etymology | editor = Hoad, T.F. | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 1996 | accessdate = 4 March 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zeno.org/Meyers-1905/A/G%C4%93r |title=Meyers Encyclopedia:Ger |publisher=Zeno.org |accessdate=26 September 2010}}</ref>

===Germanic tribes 750 BC–260===
{{Main|Germanic peoples|Germania}}
[[File:Germanic tribes (750BC-1AD).png|thumb|left|Expansion of the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribes]] 750 BC – AD&nbsp;1]]
The [[ethnogenesis]] of the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribes]] is assumed to have occurred during the [[Nordic Bronze Age]], or at the latest during the [[Pre-Roman Iron Age]]. From southern Scandinavia and northern Germany, the tribes began expanding south, east and west in the 1st century&nbsp;BC, coming into contact with the [[Celt]]ic tribes of [[Gaul]] as well as [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]], [[Balts|Baltic]], and [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] tribes in [[Eastern Europe]]. Little is known about early Germanic history, except through their recorded interactions with the [[Roman Empire]], etymological research and archaeological finds.<ref name="Claster">{{cite book | first = Jill N. | last = Claster | title = Medieval Experience: 300–1400 | publisher = [[New York University Press]] | year = 1982 | page = 35 | isbn=0-8147-1381-5 }}</ref>

Under [[Augustus]], the Roman General [[Publius Quinctilius Varus]] began to invade Germania (a term used by the Romans to define a territory running roughly from the [[Rhine]] to the [[Ural Mountains]]), and it was in this period that the Germanic tribes became familiar with Roman tactics of warfare while maintaining their tribal identity. In AD&nbsp;9, three [[Roman legion]]s led by Varus were defeated by the [[Cheruscan]] leader [[Arminius]] in the [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest]]. Modern Germany, as far as the [[Rhine]] and the [[Danube]], thus remained outside the Roman Empire. By AD&nbsp;100, the time of [[Tacitus]]' ''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]'', Germanic tribes settled along the Rhine and the Danube (the [[Limes Germanicus]]) , occupying most of the area of modern Germany; Austria, southern [[Bavaria]] and the western [[Rhineland]], however, were Roman provinces. The 3rd century saw the emergence of a number of large West Germanic tribes: [[Alamanni]], [[Franks]], [[Chatti]], [[Saxons]], [[Frisians]], [[Sicambri]], and [[Thuringii]]. Around 260, the Germanic peoples broke through the Limes and the Danube frontier into Roman-controlled lands.<ref name="Cambridge ancient history">{{cite book | series= The Cambridge Ancient History | title = The crisis of empire, A.D. 193–337 | volume = 12 | page = 442 | isbn=0-521-30199-8 | first = Alan K. | last = Bowman | first2 = Peter | last2 = Garnsey | first3 = Averil | last3 = Cameron | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 2005}}</ref>

===Migration Period and Frankish Empire 260-800===
{{Main|Migration Period|Franks}}
After the invasion of the [[Huns]] 375 and with the decline of Rome from 395 began the great migration, during which the Germanic tribes moved further and further to the southwest. Simultaneously several large tribes formed on the territory of modern Germany and displaced the smaller Germanic tribes. These were the [[Franks]] and [[Alamanni]] in the West, the [[Saxons]] in the North, the [[Bavarians]] in the South and the [[Thuringians]] in the East who walked into the nearly deserted areas of today's East Germany in the 7th Century to the Elbe-Saale line which marked the new border to the Slavic tribes. Large segments of the population of today's East Germany were characterized as Slavic (Germania Slavica) in the Early Middle Age. Only during the High Middle Ages, they were assimilated ([[Ostsiedlung]]). The main part of Western and Central Europe and thus also large areas of today's South and West Germany were occupied by the Franks, now Northern Germany was ruled by the Saxons and Slavs. All areas of the former [[Frankish Empire]] associated with todays Germany were in the eastern part of the empire, which had been known since the [[Merovingian]] period as [[Austrasia]]. A certain self-rule of Austrasia appeared the first time in 614 as King [[Clotaire II]] had to sign the ''Edictum Chlotharii'', in which it was confirmed that each of the three Frankish sub-kingdoms (Neustria, Austrasia, Burgundy) came under the rule of a [[Mayor of the Palace]].

===Holy Roman Empire 962–1806===

[[File:Weltliche Schatzkammer Wien (169)pano.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Imperial Crown of the Holy Roman Empire|Imperial Crown]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], created around AD&nbsp;1000]]

On 25 December 800, [[Charlemagne]] founded the [[Carolingian Empire]], which was [[Treaty of Verdun|divided in 843]]. The medieval empire resulted from the [[East Francia|eastern portion]] of this division and existed in varying forms from 962 until 1806. Its territory stretched from the [[Eider River]] in the north to the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] coast in the south. Often referred to as the [[Holy Roman Empire]] (or the Old Empire), it was officially called the ''Sacrum Romanum Imperium Nationis Germanicæ'' (Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation) starting in 1448, to adjust the title to its then reduced territory.

[[File:Martin Luther by Lucas Cranach der Ältere.jpeg|thumb|left|150px|[[Martin Luther]] initiated the [[Protestant Reformation]].]]

Under the reign of the [[Ottonian]] emperors (919–1024), the [[Stem duchy|duchies]] of [[Duchy of Lorraine|Lorraine]], [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxony]], [[Franconia]], [[Swabia]], [[Thuringia]], and [[Bavaria]] were consolidated, and the German king was crowned [[Holy Roman Emperor]] of these regions in 962. Under the reign of the [[Salian]] emperors (1024–1125), the Holy Roman Empire absorbed northern Italy and [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]], although the emperors lost power through the [[Investiture Controversy]]. Under the [[House of Hohenstaufen|Hohenstaufen]] emperors (1138–1254), the German princes increased their influence further south and east into territories inhabited by [[Slavic peoples|Slavs]], preceding [[History of German settlement in Eastern Europe|German settlement]] in these areas and further east ''([[Ostsiedlung]])''. Northern German towns grew prosperous as members of the [[Hanseatic League]]. Starting with the [[Great Famine of 1315–1317|Great Famine]] in 1315, then the [[Black Death]] of 1348–50, the population of Germany plummeted.<ref>{{ cite book | url=http://www.vlib.us/medieval/lectures/black_death.html | title = The Great Famine (1315–1317) and the Black Death (1346–1351) | first = Lynn Harry | last = Nelson | publisher = [[University of Kansas]] }}</ref>

The edict of the [[Golden Bull of 1356|Golden Bull]] in 1356 provided the basic constitution of the empire that lasted until its dissolution. It codified the election of the emperor by seven [[prince-elector]]s who ruled some of the most powerful principalities and archbishoprics. Beginning in the 15th century, the emperors were elected nearly exclusively from the [[Habsburg]] dynasty of [[Archduchy of Austria|Austria]].

The monk [[Martin Luther]] publicised his [[The 95 Theses|95 Theses]] in 1517, challenging practices of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], initiating the [[Protestant Reformation]]. A separate [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] church became the official religion in many German states after 1530. Religious conflict led to the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–1648), which devastated German lands.<ref>Rempel, Gerhard.

===Restoration and revolution 1814–1871===
{{Main|German Confederation}}
[[File:Nationalversammlung.jpg|thumb|[[Frankfurt parliament]] in 1848]]

Following the fall of [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]], the [[Congress of Vienna]] convened in 1814 and founded the [[German Confederation]] (Deutscher Bund), a loose league of [[List of German Confederation member states|39 sovereign states]]. Disagreement with [[European Restoration|restoration]] politics partly led to the rise of [[Liberalism in Germany|liberal]] movements, demanding unity and freedom. These, however, were followed by new measures of repression by the Austrian statesman [[Klemens Wenzel von Metternich|Metternich]]. The ''[[Zollverein]]'', a tariff union, profoundly furthered economic unity in the German states. During this era many [[Germans]] had been stirred by the ideals of the [[French Revolution]], and [[nationalism]] became a more significant force, especially among young intellectuals. For the first time, the colours of black, red and gold were chosen to represent the movement, which later became the [[Flag of Germany|national colours]].<ref>Martin, Norman. [http://www.fotw.net/flags/de1848.html German Confederation 1815–1866 (Germany)]. Flags of the World. 5 October 2000. Retrieved 7 December 2006.</ref>

In the light of a [[Revolutions of 1848|series of revolutionary movements in Europe]], which successfully established a republic [[Revolutions of 1848 in France|in France]], intellectuals and commoners started the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states]]. The monarchs initially yielded to the revolutionaries' liberal demands. King [[Frederick William IV of Prussia]] was offered the title of [[Emperor]], but with a loss of power; he rejected the crown and the proposed constitution, leading to a temporary setback for the movement. Conflict between King [[William I, German Emperor|William I]] of [[Prussia]] and the increasingly liberal parliament erupted over military reforms in 1862, and the king appointed [[Otto von Bismarck]] the new [[Prime Minister of Prussia]]. Bismarck successfully waged [[Second War of Schleswig|war on Denmark]] in 1864. Prussian victory in the [[Austro-Prussian War]] of 1866 enabled him to create the [[North German Federation]] (Norddeutscher Bund) and to exclude [[Austrian Empire|Austria]], formerly the leading German state, from the affairs of the remaining German states.

===German Empire 1871–1918===
{{Main|German Empire|World War I}}
[[File:Wernerprokla.jpg|thumb|right|Foundation of modern Germany in [[Versailles]], France, 1871. [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]] is at the centre in a white uniform.]]

The state known as ''Germany'' was [[political union|unified]] as a modern nation-state in 1871, when the [[German Empire]] was forged, with the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] as its largest constituent.
After the French defeat in the [[Franco-Prussian War]], the German Empire was proclaimed in [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]] on 18 January 1871. The [[House of Hohenzollern|Hohenzollern]] dynasty of Prussia ruled the new empire, whose capital was Berlin. The empire was a unification of all the scattered parts of Germany except Austria ({{lang|de|[[Kleindeutsche Lösung|''Kleindeutschland'']]}}, or "Lesser Germany"). But internally the official political unification came rather sequentially: Germany had no national flag until 1892 and no national hymn until after WW I. Beginning in 1884, Germany began establishing [[List of former German colonies|several colonies]] outside Europe.

[[File:Map-DR-Prussia.svg|left|thumb|Imperial Germany (1871–1918), with the dominant [[Kingdom of Prussia]] in blue]]

In the {{lang|de|''[[Gründerzeit]]''}} period following the [[unification of Germany]], Emperor [[William I, German Emperor|William I's]] foreign policy secured Germany's position as a great nation by forging alliances, isolating [[French Third Republic|France]] by diplomatic means, and avoiding war. Under [[William II, German Emperor|William II]], however, Germany, [[New Imperialism|like other European powers]], took an [[imperialism|imperialistic]] course leading to friction with neighbouring countries. Most alliances in which Germany had been previously involved were not renewed, and new alliances excluded the country. Specifically, France established new relationships by signing the [[Entente Cordiale]] with Great Britain and securing ties with the [[Russian Empire]]. Aside from its contacts with [[Austria-Hungary]], Germany became increasingly isolated.

Germany's imperialism reached outside its own country, and it joined many other powers in Europe in claiming its share of Africa. The [[Berlin Conference]] divided Africa between the European powers. Germany owned several pieces of land in Africa including [[German East Africa]], [[German South-West Africa|South-West Africa]], [[Togoland|Togo]], and [[Cameroon]]. The [[Scramble for Africa]] caused tension between the [[great power]]s that may have contributed to the conditions that led to [[World War I]].

The [[Assassination in Sarajevo|assassination]] of [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Austria's crown prince]] on 28 June 1914 triggered [[World War I]]. Germany, as part of the unsuccessful [[Central Powers]], suffered defeat against the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]] in [[World War I casualties|one of the bloodiest]] conflicts of all time. An estimated two million German soldiers died in World War I.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,530319,00.html | title = Last German World War I Veteran Believed to Have Died | newspaper = Spiegel Online | date = 22 January 2008 | first = David | last = Crossland }}</ref> The [[German Revolution]] broke out in November 1918, and Emperor William II and all German ruling princes [[abdication|abdicated]]. An [[Armistice with Germany (Compiègne)|armistice]] putting an end to the war was signed on 11 November, and Germany was forced to sign the [[Treaty of Versailles]] in June 1919. Its negotiation, contrary to traditional post-war diplomacy, excluded the defeated Central Powers. The treaty was perceived in Germany as a humiliating continuation of the war. The treaty's harshness is often cited as an influence toward the later rise of [[Nazism]] in the country.<ref name="lee h">{{cite book | first = Stephen J. | last = Lee | title = Europe, 1890–1945 | publisher = Routledge | year = 2003 | page = 131 | isbn = 0-415-25455-8 | location = London}}</ref>

===Weimar Republic 1919–1933===
{{Main|Weimar Republic}}
[[File:Ausrufung Republik Scheidemann.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Philipp Scheidemann]] proclaiming the German Republic in 1918. The [[Weimar Republic|Weimar]] era was dominated by political unrest.]]

At the beginning of the German Revolution, Germany was declared a [[republic]] and the monarchy collapsed. However, the struggle for power continued, with radical-left communists [[Bavarian Socialist Republic|seizing power in Bavaria]], but failing to take control of all of Germany. The revolution came to an end in August 1919, when the [[Weimar Republic]] was formally established. The [[Weimar Constitution]] came into effect with its signing by [[President of Germany|President]] [[Friedrich Ebert]] on 11 August 1919.

Suffering from the [[Great Depression]], the harsh peace conditions dictated by the [[Treaty of Versailles]], and a long succession of more or less unstable governments, the people of Germany increasingly lacked identification with their political system and the "Establishment Parties" in their [[parliamentary democracy]]. This was exacerbated by a widespread right-wing ([[monarchism|monarchist]], ''[[Völkisch movement|völkisch]]'', and Nazi) {{lang|de|''[[Dolchstoßlegende]]''}}, which promoted the view that Germany had lost World War I because of the efforts and influence of those who wanted to overthrow the government. The top brass of the Weimar government was accused of betraying the German Nation by signing the Versailles Treaty, while the radical left-wing [[communism|communists]], such as the [[Spartacist League]], had wanted a revolution to abolish "[[capitalism|capitalist rule]]" in favour of a {{lang|de|''[[Council communism|Räterepublik]]''}}, and were also targeted.

Discontentment with the new Weimar government helped fuel the growth of the [[Communist Party of Germany|German Communist Party]]. Many conservatives were drawn towards the reactionary/revolutionary right, particularly the National Socialist German Workers Party—the [[Nazi Party]]. By 1932, these two parties controlled the majority of parliament (296 total parliamentary seats by July 1932). After a series of unsuccessful cabinets, President [[Paul von Hindenburg]] made a crucial decision: on 30 January 1933, seeing little alternative and pushed by right-wing advisors, von Hindenburg appointed [[Adolf Hitler]] as [[Chancellor of Germany (German Reich)|Chancellor of Germany]], honouring Hitler's request.

On 27 February 1933 the [[Reichstag fire|Reichstag]] building went up in flames, and a consequent [[Reichstag Fire Decree|emergency decree]] abrogated basic citizens' rights. An [[Enabling Act]] passed in parliament gave Hitler unrestricted legislative power. Only the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] voted against it, while [[KPD|Communist]] [[Member of Parliament|MPs]] had already been imprisoned.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dhm.de/lemo/html/nazi/innenpolitik/ermaechtigungsgesetz/index.html |title=Das Ermächtigungsgesetz 1933 |accessdate=12 September 2008 |publisher=[[Deutsches Historisches Museum]]| language=German |quote=An der Abstimmung nicht teilnehmen konnten die 81 Abgeordneten der Kommunistischen Partei Deutschlands (KPD).

Leading to [[World War II]] and roughly in parallel with military rearmament, German foreign policy became more aggressive and [[Lebensraum|expansionistic]]. In 1938 and 1939, [[Anschluss|Austria]] and [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovakia]] were brought under control and the [[invasion of Poland]] prepared through the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop pact]] and [[Operation Himmler]]. On 1 September 1939 the German [[Wehrmacht]] launched a [[blitzkrieg]] on [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]], which was swiftly occupied by Germany and by the Soviet [[Red Army]]. The UK and France declared war on Germany, marking the beginning of World War II in Europe. As the war progressed, Germany and its [[Axis powers|allies]] quickly gained control of much of [[Occupied Europe|continental Europe]] while the plan to [[Operation Sea Lion|occupy the United Kingdom]] failed.

[[File:Potsdamer Platz 1945.jpg|thumb|left|Berlin in ruins after [[World War II]], [[Potsdamer Platz]] 1945]]On 22 June 1941, Germany broke the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop pact]] and [[Operation Barbarossa|invaded the Soviet Union]]. The same year, [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|attacked]] the American base at Pearl Harbor, and Germany declared war on the United States as a consequence of its alliance with Japan. Although the German army advanced into the Soviet Union quite rapidly, the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] marked a major turning point in the war. Subsequently, the German army started to retreat on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern front]]. In September 1943, Germany's ally Italy surrendered, and German forces were forced to defend an additional front in Italy. [[Normandy Landings|D-Day]] marked another major turning point in the war, opening up a [[Western Front (World War II)|Western front]]; the Allied forces landed on the beaches of [[Normandy]] and made advances towards German territory. Germany's defeat soon followed. On 8 May 1945, [[Victory in Europe Day|the German armed forces surrendered]] after the [[Red Army]] occupied Berlin. Approximately seven million German soldiers and civilians – including [[ethnic Germans]] from Eastern Europe – died during World War II.<ref>Steinberg, Heinz Günter.

In what later became known as [[The Holocaust]], the Third Reich regime enacted governmental policies directly subjugating many dissidents and minorities.

The remaining national territory and Berlin were partitioned by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] into four military occupation zones.

The western sectors, controlled by France, the United Kingdom, and the United States, were merged on 23 May 1949, to form the ''[[West Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]]'' (''Bundesrepublik Deutschland''); on 7 October 1949, the Soviet Zone became the ''[[East Germany|German Democratic Republic]]'' (''Deutsche Demokratische Republik'', or DDR). They were, mainly outside Germany, informally known as "West Germany" and "East Germany", and the two parts of Berlin as "[[West Berlin]]" and "[[East Berlin]]". East Germany selected East Berlin as its capital, while West Germany chose [[Bonn]]. However, West Germany declared the status of its capital Bonn as provisional, in order to emphasise its stance that the two-state solution was an artificial ''status quo'' that was to be overcome one day.<ref name="provisional">{{cite book | last = Wise | first = Michael Z. | title = Capital dilemma: Germany's search for a new architecture of democracy| year = 1998| publisher = Princeton Architectural Press | isbn =978-1-56898-134-5 | page = 23 | chapter = Bonn, Capital of Self-Effacement}}</ref>

West Germany, established as a federal parliamentary republic with a "[[social market economy]]", was allied with the United States, the UK and France. The country came to enjoy prolonged economic growth beginning in the early 1950s ({{lang|de|''[[Wirtschaftswunder]]''}}). West Germany joined [[NATO]] in 1955 and was a founding member of the [[European Economic Community]] in 1957. On 1 January 1957, following a plebiscite, [[Saarland]] became part of West Germany by virtue of article 23 {{lang|de|''[[Grundgesetz]]''}}, having been occupied by France since 1947.

[[File:Thefalloftheberlinwall1989.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Berlin Wall]] in front of the [[Brandenburg Gate]] shortly after its opening in 1989]]

East Germany was an [[Eastern bloc]] state under political and military control by the [[USSR]] via the latter's occupation forces and the [[Warsaw Pact]]. While claiming to be a democracy, political power was solely executed by leading members (''[[Politburo]]'') of the communist-controlled [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|SED (''Socialist Unity Party of Germany'')]]. Their power was ensured by the [[Stasi]], a secret service of immense size, and a variety of SED suborganizations controlling every aspect of society. In return, the basic needs of the population were satisfied at low cost by the state. A Soviet-style [[command economy]] was set up; later, the GDR became a [[Comecon]] state. While [[Communist propaganda|East German propaganda]] was based on the benefits of the GDR's social programs and the alleged constant threat of a West German invasion, many of her citizens looked to the West for political freedoms and economic prosperity.<ref>{{cite news | last = Colchester | first = Nico | url = http://www.ft.com/cms/s/504285c4-68b6-11da-bd30-0000779e2340,dwp_uuid=6f876a3c-e19f-11da-bf4c-0000779e2340.html | title = D-mark day dawns | newspaper = [[Financial Times]] | location = London | date = 1 January 2001 | accessdate = 7 December 2006 }}</ref> The [[Berlin Wall]], built in 1961 to stop East Germans from escaping to West Germany, became a symbol of the [[Cold War]].

Tensions between East and West Germany were somewhat reduced in the early 1970s by Chancellor [[Willy Brandt]]'s {{lang|de|''[[Ostpolitik]]''}}, which included the ''de facto'' acceptance of Germany's territorial losses in World War II.

In summer 1989, Hungary decided (2 May) to dismantle the [[Iron Curtain]] and open the borders (23 August), causing an exodus of thousands of [[East Germans]] (11 September) to West Germany via Hungary.
This had devastating effects on the [[GDR]], with [[Monday demonstrations in East Germany|mass demonstrations]]. The East German authorities unexpectedly eased the border restrictions in November, allowing East German citizens to travel to the West. Originally intended as a pressure valve to retain East Germany as a state, the opening of the border actually led to an acceleration of the [[Die Wende|''Wende'' reform process]] in East Germany, which finally concluded with the ''[[Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany|Two Plus Four Treaty]]'' a year later on 12 September 1990, under which the four occupying powers renounced their rights under the Instrument of Surrender, and Germany regained full [[sovereignty]]. This permitted [[German reunification]] on 3 October 1990, with the accession of the five re-established states in the former GDR ([[New states of Germany|new states]] or "neue Länder").

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Germany}}
[[File:Deutschland topo.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Topographic map]]

Germany is located in the Central Europe, the territory covers {{convert|357021|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}, consisting of {{convert|349223|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}} of land and {{convert|7798|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}} of water. It is the seventh largest country by area in Europe and the 63rd largest in the world. It lies mostly between latitudes [[47th parallel north|47°]] and [[55th parallel north|55° N]] (the tip of [[Sylt]] is just north of 55°), and longitudes [[5th meridian east|5°]] and [[16th meridian east|16° E]].

Elevation ranges from the mountains of the [[Alps]] (highest point: the [[Zugspitze]] at {{convert|2962|m|ft|0|disp=s}}) in the south to the shores of the [[North Sea]] (Nordsee) in the north-west and the [[Baltic Sea]] (Ostsee) in the north-east. Between lie the forested uplands of central Germany and the low-lying lands of northern Germany (lowest point: [[Wilstermarsch]] at {{convert|3.54|m|ft|1|disp=s}} below sea level), traversed by some of Europe's major rivers such as the [[Rhine]], [[Danube]] and [[Elbe]].<ref name="CIA">{{Cite web| url = https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/gm.html| title = CIA Factbook | accessdate = 23 October 2010| author=CIA | authorlink = Central Intelligence Agency}}</ref>

Germany shares borders with more European countries than any other country on the continent. Its neighbours are Denmark in the north, Poland and the Czech Republic in the east, Austria and Switzerland in the south, France and [[Luxembourg]] in the south-west and Belgium and the Netherlands in the north-west.

The most significant natural resources are iron ore, coal, [[potash]], timber, [[lignite]], [[uranium]], copper, natural gas, [[salt]], nickel, [[arable land]] and water.

Most of Germany has a [[temperate|temperate seasonal climate]] in which humid westerly winds predominate. The climate is moderated by the [[North Atlantic Current|North Atlantic Drift]], which is the northern extension of the [[Gulf Stream]]. This warmer water affects the areas bordering the North Sea including the area along the Rhine, which flows into the North Sea. Consequently in the north-west and the north, the climate is [[oceanic climate|oceanic]]; [[Precipitation (meteorology)|rainfall]] occurs year round with a maximum during summer.

Winters are mild and summers tend to be cool, though temperatures can exceed {{convert|30|°C|°F|lk=on}} for prolonged periods. In the east, the climate is more [[continental climate|continental]]; winters can be very cold, summers can be very warm, and long dry periods are often recorded. Central and southern Germany are transition regions which vary from moderately oceanic to continental.

In addition to the maritime and continental climates that predominate over most of the country, the Alpine regions in the extreme south and, to a lesser degree, some areas of the Central German Uplands have a so-called mountain climate. This climate is characterised by lower temperatures because of higher altitudes and greater precipitation caused by air becoming moisture-laden as it lifts over higher terrain.<ref>[http://www.germanculture.com.ua/library/facts/bl_climate.htm Climate In Germany] GermanCulture.

[[Phytogeography|Phytogeographically]], Germany is shared between the Atlantic European and Central European provinces of the [[Circumboreal Region]] within the [[Boreal Kingdom]]. The territory of Germany can be subdivided into two [[ecoregion]]s: European-Mediterranean montane mixed forests and Northeast-Atlantic shelf marine.<ref>[http://www.panda.org/about_our_earth/ecoregions/ecoregion_list/ List of Ecoregions: Terrestrial Ecoregions] WWF. Retrieved 21 November 2000.</ref> The majority of Germany is covered by either [[arable land]] (33%) or [[forestry]] and [[woodland]] (31%). Only 15% is covered by permanent pastures.

Plants and animals are those generally common to middle Europe. Beeches, oaks, and other deciduous trees constitute one-third of the forests; conifers are increasing as a result of reforestation. Spruce and fir trees predominate in the upper mountains, while pine and larch are found in sandy soil. There are many species of ferns, flowers, fungi, and mosses. Fish abound in the rivers and the North Sea. Wild animals include deer, wild boar, mouflon, fox, badger, hare, and small numbers of beavers. Various migratory birds cross Germany in the spring and autumn.

The [[List of national parks of Germany|national parks in Germany]] include the [[Wadden Sea National Parks]], the [[Jasmund National Park]], the [[Vorpommern Lagoon Area National Park]], the [[Müritz National Park]], the [[Lower Oder Valley National Park]], the [[Harz National Park]], the [[Saxon Switzerland National Park]] and the [[Bavarian Forest National Park]].

Nevertheless Germany's [[List of countries by carbon dioxide emissions per capita|carbon dioxide emissions per capita]] are among the highest in the EU, although they are significantly lower than those of Australia, Canada, Saudi Arabia and the United States.

Emissions from coal-burning utilities and industries contribute to air pollution. Acid rain, resulting from sulphur dioxide emissions, continues to damage German forests. Pollution in the Baltic Sea from raw sewage and industrial effluents from rivers in former East Germany have been reduced. The government under Chancellor Schröder announced the intention to end the use of nuclear power for producing electricity. Germany is working to meet EU commitments to identify nature preservation areas in line with the EU's Flora, Fauna, and Habitat directive. Germany's last glaciers in the Alpine region are experiencing deglaciation. Natural hazards are river flooding in spring and stormy winds occurring in all regions.

==Politics==
{{Main|Politics of Germany}}
[[File:Politisches System des Bundes und der Länder in Deutschland.svg|thumb|230px|The political system of Germany is written down in the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|Basic Law (Grundgesetz)]]. ]]

Germany is a [[federal republic|federal]], [[parliamentary democratic|parliamentary]], [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] republic. The German political system operates under a framework laid out in the 1949 constitutional document known as the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|''Grundgesetz'']] (Basic Law). By calling the document ''Grundgesetz'', rather than ''Verfassung'' (constitution), the authors expressed the intention that it would be replaced by a proper constitution once Germany was reunited as one state.

Amendments to the ''Grundgesetz'' generally require a two-thirds majority of both chambers of the parliament; the fundamental principles of the constitution, as expressed in the articles guaranteeing human dignity, the separation of powers, the federal structure, and the rule of law are valid in perpetuity.<ref name="Art 79">{{Cite web|url=http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/gg/art_79.html|title=Article 79 of the ''Grundgesetz''|work=Bundesministerium der Justiz|publisher=www.gesetze-im-internet.de|language=German|accessdate=7 December 2008}}</ref> Despite the initial intention, the ''Grundgesetz'' remained in effect after the [[German reunification]] in 1990, with only minor amendments.

===Government===
[[File:Christian Wulff 2008-04-17.jpg|thumb|left|[[Christian Wulff]] has been the [[President of Germany]] since June 2010. The head of state holds primarily representative powers.]]

The President, [[Christian Wulff]], is the [[head of state]] and invested primarily with representative responsibilities and powers. He is elected by the ''[[Bundesversammlung (Germany)|Bundesversammlung]]'' (federal convention), an institution consisting of the members of the ''Bundestag'' and an equal number of state delegates.

The second highest official in the [[German order of precedence]] is the ''Bundestagspräsident'' ([[President of the Bundestag|President of the ''Bundestag'']]), who is elected by the ''Bundestag'' and responsible for overseeing the daily sessions of the body.

The third-highest official and the [[head of government]] is the Chancellor, who is appointed by the ''Bundespräsident'' after being elected by the ''Bundestag''. The Chancellor can be removed by a [[constructive vote of no confidence]] by the ''Bundestag'', where constructive implies that the ''Bundestag'' simultaneously has to elect a successor.

[[File:Reichstag building Berlin view from west before sunset.jpg|thumb|290px|The [[Reichstag (building)|Reichstag]] in Berlin is the site of the German parliament (Bundestag)]]

The [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]]—currently [[Angela Merkel]]—is the [[head of government]] and exercises [[executive (government)|executive power]], similar to the role of a Prime Minister in other [[parliamentary system|parliamentary democracies]]. Federal [[legislative power]] is vested in the parliament consisting of the ''[[Bundestag]]'' (Federal Diet) and ''[[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]]'' (Federal Council), which together form a unique type of legislative body. The ''Bundestag'' is elected through [[direct election]]s, by [[proportional representation]] ([[mixed member proportional representation|mixed-member]]). The members of the ''Bundesrat'' represent the governments of the [[States of Germany|sixteen federated states]] and are members of the state cabinets. The respective state governments have the right to appoint and remove their envoys at any time.

Since 1949, the party system has been dominated by the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]] and the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] with all chancellors hitherto being member of either party. However, the smaller liberal [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (which has had members in the ''Bundestag'' since 1949) and the [[Alliance '90/The Greens]] (which has controlled seats in parliament since 1983) have also played important roles,<ref>[http://countrystudies.us/germany/159.htm Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union] U.S. Library of Congress. Retrieved 7 December 2006.</ref> as they are regularly the smaller partner of a [[coalition government]].

===Law===
{{Main|Judiciary of Germany|Law enforcement in Germany}}
[[File:Karlsruhe bundesverfassungsgericht.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany|Federal Constitutional Court]] (Bundesverfassungsgericht) in [[Karlsruhe]]]]

The [[Judiciary of Germany]] is independent of the executive and the legislative branches. Germany has a [[civil law (legal system)|civil or statute law system]] that is based on [[Roman law]] with some references to [[Germanic law]]. The ''[[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany|Bundesverfassungsgericht]]'' (Federal Constitutional Court), located in Karlsruhe, is the German Supreme Court responsible for constitutional matters, with power of [[judicial review]].<ref>[http://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/en/index.html Federal Constitutional Court], Bundesverfassungsgericht.de. Retrieved 13 April 2007.</ref> It acts as the highest legal authority and ensures that legislative and judicial practice conforms to the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany]] (Basic Law). It acts independently of the other state bodies, but cannot act on its own behalf.

Germany's supreme court system, called ''Oberste Gerichtshöfe des Bundes'', is specialised. For civil and criminal cases, the highest court of appeal is the [[Federal Court of Justice of Germany|Federal Court of Justice]], located in [[Karlsruhe]] and [[Leipzig]]. The courtroom style is [[inquisitorial system|inquisitorial]]. Other Federal Courts are the [[Federal Labor Court of Germany|Federal Labour Court]] in [[Erfurt]], the [[Bundessozialgericht|Federal Social Court]] in [[Kassel]], the [[Federal Finance Court of Germany|Federal Finance Court]] in [[Munich]] and the [[Federal Administrative Court of Germany|Federal Administrative Court]] in Leipzig.

[[File:HH Polizeihauptmeister MZ.jpg|thumb|150px|left|German [[Landespolizei|state police]] officer in [[Hamburg]]]]

[[Criminal law]] and [[private law]] are codified on the national level in the ''[[Strafgesetzbuch]]'' and the ''[[Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch]]'' respectively. The German penal system is aimed towards rehabilitation of the criminal; its secondary goal is the protection of the general public.<ref>{{de icon}} [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/stvollzg/__2.html § 2 Strafvollzugsgesetz] Bundesministerium der Justiz. Retrieved 19 November 2009.</ref> To achieve the latter, a convicted criminal can be put in preventive detention (''Sicherungsverwahrung'') in addition to the regular sentence if he is considered to be a threat to the general public. The ''[[Völkerstrafgesetzbuch]]'' regulates the consequences of [[crimes against humanity]], [[genocide]] and [[war crimes]]. It gives German courts [[universal jurisdiction]] if prosecution by a court of the country where the crime was committed, or by an international court, is not possible.

Legislative power is divided between the federation and the state level. The Basic Law presumes that all legislative power remains at the state level unless otherwise designated by the Basic Law itself.

Any federal law overrides state law if the legislative power lies at the federal level. A famous example is the purported Hessian provision for the death penalty, which goes against the ban on capital punishment under the Basic Law, rendering the Hessian provision invalid. The ''[[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]]'' is the federal organ through which the states participate in national legislation. State participation in federal legislation is necessary if the law falls within the area of concurrent legislative power, requires states to administer federal regulations, or is so designated by the Basic Law. Every state has its own constitutional court. The ''[[Amtsgericht]]e'', ''Landgerichte'' and ''Oberlandesgerichte'' are state courts of [[general jurisdiction]]. They are competent whether the action is based on federal or state law.

Many of the fundamental matters of [[administrative law]] remain in the jurisdiction of the states, though most states base their own laws in that area on the 1976 ''Verwaltungsverfahrensgesetz'' (Administrative Proceedings Act) covering important points of administrative law. The ''Oberverwaltungsgerichte'' are the highest level of administrative jurisdiction concerning the state administrations, unless the question of law concerns federal law or state law identical to federal law. In such cases, final appeal to the Federal Administrative Court is possible.

With its central position in Europe, Germany is an important transportation hub. This is reflected in its dense and modern transportation networks. The extensive motorway ([[Autobahn]]) network ranks worldwide third largest in its total length and features a lack of blanket speed limits on the majority of routes.<ref name="adac">{{Cite web|authorlink=www.adac.de/verkehrs-experten|title=Autobahn-Temporegelung|publisher=[[ADAC]]|date=October 2007|url=http://www.adac.de/images/SP_Tempolimit_V%201%2E0_tcm8-199598.pdf|format=PDF|language=German|accessdate=15 November 2008}} {{Dead link|date=June 2010| bot=DASHBot}}</ref>

Germany has established a polycentric network of [[high-speed rail|high-speed trains]]. The [[InterCityExpress]] or ''ICE'' is the most advanced service category of the [[Deutsche Bahn]] and serves major German cities as well as destinations in neighbouring countries. The train maximum speed varies between 160&nbsp;km/h and 300&nbsp;km/h. Connections are offered at either 30-minute, hourly, or two-hourly intervals.<ref>{{de icon}} [http://web.archive.org/web/20070809140315/http://www.db.de/site/bahn/de/unternehmen/investor__relations/finanzberichte/geschaeftsbericht/geschaeftsbericht__2006.html Geschäftsbericht 2006 der Deutschen Bahn AG], [[Deutsche Bahn]].

The largest German airports are the [[Frankfurt International Airport]] and the [[Munich International Airport]], both are global hubs of [[Lufthansa]]. Other major airports are [[Tegel Airport|Berlin Tegel]], [[Schönefeld Airport|Berlin Schönefeld]], [[Düsseldorf International Airport|Düsseldorf]], [[Hamburg Airport|Hamburg]], [[Cologne Bonn Airport|Cologne-Bonn]], [[Leipzig/Halle Airport|Leipzig/Halle]] and in the future [[Berlin Brandenburg International Airport]].

===Energy===
{{Main|Energy in Germany}}
[[File:Windgermany.JPG|thumb|The largest [[solar power]] and [[Wind power in the European Union|second-largest wind power]] capacity in the world is installed in Germany.]]

Germany is the world's fifth largest consumer of energy, and two-thirds of its primary energy was imported in 2002. In the same year, Germany was Europe's largest consumer of electricity, totalling 512.9 terawatt-hours. Government policy promotes energy conservation and the development of [[renewable energy]] sources, such as solar, [[wind power|wind]], [[biomass]], hydroelectric, and [[geothermal power|geothermal]] energy. As a result of energy-saving measures, [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] has been improving since the beginning of the 1970s. The government has set the goal of meeting half the country's energy demands from renewable sources by 2050.

In 2000, the government and the [[Nuclear power in Germany|German nuclear power industry]] agreed to phase out all [[nuclear power plant]]s by 2021.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4295389.stm Germany split over green energy], BBC. Retrieved 13 April 2007.</ref> Renewable energy still plays a more modest role in energy consumption. In 2006, energy consumption was met by the following sources: oil (36%); coal, including lignite (24%); natural gas (23%); nuclear (13%); hydro-electric and wind power (1%); and other (4%). However, the share of renewable energy in electricity supply has been rapidly increasing, reaching 14% in 2007. The German government has set a new target to increase this share to 27% by 2020.

German is the official and predominant spoken language in Germany.<ref name="Eurobarometer Languages"/> It is one of 23 official languages in the European Union, and one of the three [[working language]]s of the [[European Commission]], along with English and French. Recognised native minority languages in Germany are Danish, [[Sorbian languages|Sorbian]], [[Romany language|Romany]], and [[Frisian languages|Frisian]]. They are officially protected by the [[ECRML]]. The most used immigrant languages are [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]], Polish, the [[Balkan languages]], and Russian.

Standard German is a [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic language]] and is closely related to and classified alongside English, [[Dutch language|Dutch]], and the [[Frisian languages]].

===Education===
{{Main|Education in Germany}}
[[File:Kindergartenfrankfurt.jpg|thumb|Kindergarten in [[Hessen]]]]

Responsibility for educational oversight in Germany lies primarily with the [[States of Germany|federated states]] individually, whilst the federal government only has a minor role.<!--Kulturhoheit--> Optional [[kindergarten]] education is provided for all children between three and six years old, after which school attendance is [[compulsory education|compulsory]] for at least nine years. Primary education usually lasts for four years and public schools are not stratified at this stage.<ref name="ED">{{PDFlink|[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Germany.pdf Country profile: Germany]|177&nbsp;KB}} U.S. Library of Congress. December 2005. Retrieved 4 December 2006.</ref> In contrast, secondary education includes three traditional types of schools based on a pupil's ability as determined by teacher recommendations: the ''[[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]]'' enrolls the most gifted children and prepares students for university studies, and attendance lasts eight or nine years depending on the state; the ''[[Realschule]]'' has a broader range of emphasis for intermediate students and lasts six years; the ''[[Hauptschule]]'' prepares pupils for vocational education.

[[File:Heidelberg Universitätsbibliothek 2003.jpg|thumb|left|The [[University of Heidelberg]] was established in 1386.]]

Since the 1960s, a reform movement attempted to unify secondary education in a ''Gesamtschule'' ([[comprehensive school]]). However, instead of overcoming the stratification, Gesamtschule just became a fourth type of secondary school. Since about 2000, several West German Länder simplified their school system to two or three tiers. Motives were: The example of Eastern Germany where in the 1990s, following reunification, a two-tier school system was established; mediocre scores in the [[Programme for International Student Assessment]] (PISA), first published in 2001, prompted a nation-wide debate about the school system, and in particular about the social selectivity of early stratification;<ref>In PISA 2000, Germany was the country with the highest correlation between test score and social background index. In the following test periods, this result could not be replicated.</ref> having low standards of achievement, inner-city Hauptschulen were increasingly considered dysfunctional by some people; outside the main metropolitan areas, the population is shrinking, so that according to some people it becomes increasingly impractical to maintain a three- or four-tier school system.

A special system of apprenticeship called ''Duale Ausbildung'' ("dual education") allows pupils in [[vocational training]] to learn in a company as well as in a state-run vocational school.<ref name="ED"/>

To enter a [[List of universities in Germany|university in Germany]], high school students are generally required to take the ''[[Abitur]]'' examination, which is similar to [[Advanced Level (UK)|A-levels in the UK]] and typically done at the age of 18 or 19. However, students possessing a diploma from a [[vocational school]] may also apply for [[matriculation]] in certain subjects. Germany's universities are recognised internationally, indicating the high education standards in the country. In the [[Academic Ranking of World Universities|ARWU]] ranking for 2008, six of the top 100 universities in the world are in Germany, and 18 in the top 200.<ref name=ARWU>{{Cite web|title=Top 100 World Universities|publisher=[[Academic Ranking of World Universities|ARWU]]|url=http://www.arwu.org/rank2008/ARWU2008_A(EN).htm|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080822124509/http://www.arwu.org/rank2008/ARWU2008_A(EN).htm|archivedate=22 August 2008|accessdate=14 March 2009}}</ref> Nearly all German universities are public (i.e. non-private) institutions, charging tuition fees ranging from €50–500 per semester for each student.<ref>[http://www.daad.de/deutschland/studium/studienplanung/00493.en.html#headline_0_1 Tuition Fees in Germany] German Academic Exchange Service.

Germany has the world's oldest [[universal health care]] system, with origins dating back to [[Otto von Bismarck]]'s [[Otto von Bismarck#Bismarck's social legislation|Social legislation]] in 1883. Currently the population is covered by a basic health insurance plan provided by statute, which provides a standard level of coverage. The remainder opt for private health insurance, which frequently offers additional benefits.

Germany ranked 20th in the world in [[life expectancy]] with [[List of countries by life expectancy|76,5 years for men and 82,1 years for woman]]. It had a very low [[infant mortality rate]] (4.3 per 1,000 [[Live birth (human)|live births]]), and it was tied for eighth place in the number of practicing physicians, at per 1,000 people (3.3).

===Philosophy===

[[File:Immanuel Kant (painted portrait).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Immanuel Kant]] (1724–1804)]]

Germany's influence on philosophy is historically significant and many notable German philosophers have helped shape [[Western philosophy]] since the Middle Ages. The rise of the modern natural sciences and the related decline of religion raised a series of questions, which recur throughout German philosophy, concerning the relationships between knowledge and faith, reason and emotion, and scientific, ethical, and artistic ways of seeing the world.

[[Gottfried Leibniz]]'s contributions to [[rationalism]]; the establishment of classical [[German idealism]] by [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] and [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling]]; [[Arthur Schopenhauer]]'s composition of metaphysical pessimism; [[Karl Marx]]'s and [[Friedrich Engels]]' formulation of [[communist theory]]; [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s development of [[perspectivism]]; [[Gottlob Frege]]'s contributions to the dawn of [[analytic philosophy]]; [[Martin Heidegger]]'s works on Being; and the development of the [[Frankfurt school]] by [[Max Horkheimer]], [[Theodor Adorno]], [[Herbert Marcuse]] and [[Jürgen Habermas]] have been particularly influential.

In the 21st century Germany has been an important country for the development of contemporary analytic philosophy in continental Europe, along with France, Austria, Switzerland and the Scandinavian countries.<ref>Searle, John.

During the last decade of the 20th century, Germany changed its attitude towards immigrants. Until the mid-1990s the opinion was widespread that Germany is not a country of immigration, even though about 20% of the population were of non-German origin. Today the government and a majority of the German society are acknowledging that immigrants from diverse ethnocultural backgrounds are part of the German society and that controlled immigration should be initiated based on qualification standards.<ref>{{Cite book | first = Friedrich | last = Heckmann | url = http://books.google.com/?id=l9yTtCAnQWwC&pg=PA53&lpg=PA53&dq=cdu+immigrant+einwanderungsland#PPA53,M1 | title = The Integration of Immigrants in European Societies: national differences and trends of convergence| publisher=Lucius & Lucius | location = Stuttgart | pages = 51 ff. | year = 2003 | isbn = 978-3-8282-0181-1 | accessdate = 28 October 2010 }}</ref>
